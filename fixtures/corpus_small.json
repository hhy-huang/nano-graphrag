        "body": "The trial of Sam Bankman-Fried is likely to be more consequential than just whether the man himself is found guilty. Depending on what evidence is introduced during the trial, it could be rough for the entire crypto industry.\n\n\u201cHow much damage can this trial do to the already beaten-down reputation of the industry at this point?\u201d asks Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University. \u201cThis trial is going to be an excruciating moment for the industry because no one knows what kind of evidence might come out.\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried, the founder of FTX and Alameda Research, is facing seven counts of criminal charges: two counts of wire fraud, and five counts of conspiracy charges. FTX was a failed cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2019. According to a now-deleted profile from FTX investors Sequoia Capital, FTX was founded because of Bankman-Fried\u2019s frustration with other exchanges when he was running Alameda Research, his crypto trading firm. According to the SEC, FTX was a fraud \u201cfrom the start,\u201d diverting customers\u2019 funds to Alameda.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is on trial for seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy. FTX was a fraud \u201cfrom the start,\u201d the Securities and Exchange Commission alleges \u2014 with a \u201cmulti-billion-dollar deficiency caused by his own misappropriation of customer funds.\u201d Follow along for all the latest news and regular updates from the trial.\n\n\u201cReally just old-fashioned embezzlement.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s left of FTX is now being led by John J. Ray III \u2014 you may remember him as the guy who cleaned up Enron and who also said FTX is worse than Enron. Just before the trial began, the FTX lawyers filed suit against Bankman-Fried\u2019s parents, saying they should give back millions of dollars they got from their kid. Ray has also referred to Bankman-Fried\u2019s conduct as \u201creally just old-fashioned embezzlement.\u201d\n\nWe have some inkling of what the government will be arguing thanks to the filings prosecutors are making in this case. They argue that Bankman-Fried lied about consumer protection and that Bankman-Fried\u2019s statements that FTX was \u201cavoiding or managing conflicts of interest\u201d and that \u201cas a general principle FTX segregates customer assets from its own assets across our platforms\u201d were lies, in a superseding indictment filed August 14th.\n\nThe indictment also says that there were special features in FTX\u2019s code that \u201cpermitted Alameda to spend and withdraw unlimited amounts of money from FTX,\u201d which were created at Bankman-Fried\u2019s direction. That effectively exempted Alameda from the kinds of risk management other customers faced. At the same time, the government alleges, \u201cBankman-Fried publicly and repeatedly asserted that Alameda did not have privileged access to FTX.\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried is accused of using \u201cbillions of dollars in misappropriated FTX customer deposits\u201d to help buy more than $200 million of real estate for himself, make billions of dollars of investments for his own interest, and repay Alameda\u2019s lenders, according to the indictment, Additionally, Bankman-Fried allegedly used more than $100 million of customer funds to make political contributions; prosecutors can show evidence of those contributions in this trial, even though they aren\u2019t part of the charges brought. A second trial is scheduled for March 2024, with additional charges.\n\nBefore his fall, Bankman-Fried made himself out to be the Good Boy of crypto \u2014 the trustworthy face of a sometimes-shady industry. He was also very interested in publicity, sitting for many interviews both before and after the fall of FTX. The quick rise of FTX as an industry force was at least in part due to Bankman-Fried\u2019s appetite for attention. Here are the hits:\n\nBankman-Fried gave interviews freely \u2014 and quickly rose to public prominence in the industry. Though FTX hadn\u2019t been in the business as long as competing exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, or Gemini, Bankman-Fried positioned himself as an important, boyish face for crypto. (At one point, Bankman-Fried told a colleague at FTX that \u201cI honestly think it\u2019s negative EV [this may mean \u201cexpected value,\u201d as in poker] for me to cut my hair. I think it\u2019s important for people to think I look crazy.\u201d)\n\nBecause he was so successful at this kind of public relations, his fall from grace was another mark against an industry that was already roiled by bankruptcies and scandals. Some additional trouble for the crypto industry is likely to come from one crucial element of the fraud trial \u2014 the part where the government must prove intent.\n\nThe first part of proving the government\u2019s case is pretty simple and a little boring: prosecutors must show that certain transactions took place. Whatever records the Southern District of New York has for the transactions will be shown.\n\n\u201cWhat conversations happened between him and his co-conspirators that are now cooperating against him?\u201d\n\nThe second part is where all the drama is likely to come, says Christopher LaVigne, a litigation partner and co-chair of the cryptocurrency practice at the law firm Withers. Prosecutors have to connect those transactions to Bankman-Fried, show that he knew what he was doing was wrong, and prove that he lied about it anyway.\n\n\u201cWhat was he saying to his parents and his other advisors about this?\u201d LaVigne says. \u201cWhat conversations happened between him and his co-conspirators that are now cooperating against him?\u201d\n\nTo further establish intent, the government can use Bankman-Fried\u2019s own words. The indictment calls Bankman-Fried\u2019s tweets in November 2022 \u201cfalse and misleading.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had him going out directly to the internet,\u201d LaVigne says. If he wrote things on Twitter or said things in interviews that weren\u2019t true, that\u2019s more fodder for the government\u2019s case. \u201cThey can point to that and say, \u2018This is what he said, this is what actually happened.\u2019\u201d\n\nOther evidence may include Signal messages and testimony from co-conspirators who plead guilty to their own charges. Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, who was also sometimes Bankman-Fried\u2019s girlfriend, may play an important role \u2014 Bankman-Fried leaked her diaries to The New York Times and was consequently jailed for witness tampering. The government has indicated FTX co-founder Gary Wang and engineering head Nishad Singh will also be among the witnesses called to give testimony about Bankman-Fried.\n\nBankman-Fried\u2019s defense can also introduce risks for people who dealt with him\n\nThere may be testimony from lenders, venture capitalists, and customers in order to establish the basis for some charges. In the indictment, the prosecutors allege that Bankman-Fried lied to FTX investors. Some of those investors may be called on to testify, which is not the kind of thing VC big shots generally enjoy \u2014 and which might create collateral damage for the industry.\n\nIf, for instance, Sequoia Capital did due diligence around its investment in FTX, whatever Bankman-Fried told its partners could be important. Was FTX already sending Alameda customer funds at that point? Did Bankman-Fried know about it? And did he tell VCs at the time? (If he told them it wasn\u2019t happening, that would establish intent.) Binance was also an early investor in FTX, and former executives may be called on to testify as well, says Hermine Wong, the former head of policy at Coinbase and a former SEC regulator.\n\nBankman-Fried\u2019s defense can also introduce risks for people who dealt with him. Defense lawyers have several simultaneous objectives. First and foremost, they\u2019re trying to prove their client is not guilty. But just in case they don\u2019t get the outcome they want, they\u2019re also laying the groundwork for appeals and sentencing arguments. Any piece of evidence they want to introduce for those two purposes has to come into play in the trial.\n\nAlready, Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers are marking arguments that his constitutional rights are being violated by his pretrial incarceration because, among other things, his internet connection wasn\u2019t good enough for him to plan his defense, notes LaVigne. That could be grounds for an appeal.\n\n\u201cIs he going to throw the entire industry under the bus?\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried\u2019s behavior after the fall of FTX suggests he\u2019s something of a wild card. He may suggest he was acting on the advice of his lawyers. But he may also introduce other evidence that could be troublesome \u2014 implying, for instance, that he was engaged in standard industry behavior or that everything that happened was Binance\u2019s fault. That may be risky, but we already know that Bankman-Fried loves risk.\n\n\u201cIs he going to throw the entire industry under the bus?\u201d Wong asks. \u201cAn idea like, \u2018Everyone was doing this, it\u2019s not fair I\u2019m the only one who was charged?\u2019\u201d That may not fly in a court of law, but it could absolutely damage public perception of crypto at large.\n\nFor instance, just before he was arrested, Bankman-Fried brought forward messages from a crypto group chat in testimony he planned to give before Congress. In that testimony, he primarily blames Binance and his lawyers at the firm Sullivan & Cromwell.\n\nIt\u2019s possible other messages from group chats may be brought into evidence during the trial. That can potentially be embarrassing for the whole industry, Wong says.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine some of these founders, CEOs, people of that echelon talk to each other somewhat informally about what\u2019s going on,\u201d she says. If it seems like his peer group supported him, or worse, fawned over him, that\u2019s a real problem for the industry\u2019s reputation.\u201d\n\nAfter FTX declared bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried went on an extensive media tour, doing interviews with The New York Times\u2019 Andrew Ross Sorkin and Good Morning America. Even under house arrest, he did interviews, including with The New Yorker. Bankman-Fried seemed to think that if he just explained things, everyone would understand that what he did was a mistake, not a crime."

        "body": "SBF\u2019s trial has started, this is how he and FTX got here\n\nThe highly anticipated criminal trial for Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, started Tuesday to determine whether he\u2019s guilty of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. And as one former federal prosecutor put it: \u201cThe odds seem to be stacked against him at this point.\u201d\n\nThe 31-year-old co-founded FTX in 2019; within a few years the once third-largest crypto exchange\u2019s valuation hit $32 billion at its peak. It\u2019s now trying to claw back any funds to distribute to creditors.\n\nBut how did the once third-largest crypto exchange get here?\n\nBefore FTX, Bankman-Fried co-founded crypto-trading firm Alameda Research in 2017. He co-founded FTX in 2019 as a complement to Alameda, to help bring in revenue and liquidity for the trading arm.\n\nWithin two years, more than 80 investors provided about $2 billion in capital to FTX, helping Bankman-Fried propel his vision into a reality. In January 2022, the company raised $400 million in a Series C round, boosting its valuation to $32 billion. That was its last round of public funding.\n\nThe company gained somewhat mainstream recognition with branding deals and partnerships. For example, in 2021 it bought the naming rights for the Miami Heat\u2019s home arena. FTX also got its name branded on Major League Baseball umpires\u2019 polos, and it partnered with celebrities like Tom Brady and his ex-wife, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, as well as Steph Curry, Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Naomi Osaka, among others. He also had close ties to U.S. regulators and government officials, many of whom he donated to.\n\nBankman-Fried was even compared to Warren Buffet and many called him the white horse of crypto (TechCrunch never did, for what it\u2019s worth).\n\nBut in early November 2022, that all changed.\n\nFTX\u2019s collapse\n\nConcerns surrounding FTX\u2019s liquidity grew after CoinDesk published a copy of Alameda\u2019s balance sheet, showing the firm held $14.6 billion in assets and $8 billion in liabilities as of June 30, 2022.\n\nBut there was a problem: The report showed Alameda\u2019s largest asset was $3.66 billion of \u201cunlocked FTT\u201d and $2.16 billion of \u201cFTT collateral.\u201d FTT was the token behind FTX.\n\nThe balance sheet showed that the $5.82 billion in FTT tokens that Alameda owned was 193% higher than the total FTT market cap, which was about $3 billion at the time. That means it purported to have more FTT tokens on its balance sheet than what existed in the world.\n\nAround the same time it was exposed, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance, started pulling out its remaining $2.1 billion equivalent of cash in BUSD and FTT. (It had an equity position in FTX from 2019 to 2021.) This essentially triggered a bank run on FTX.\n\nFTX and Alameda filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. mid-November 2022. Bankman-Fried resigned, and John J. Ray III, the Enron turnaround veteran, was appointed its new CEO.\n\nBankman-Fried, however, maintained his innocence. At The New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit, he appeared virtually from the Bahamas, saying \u201cI didn\u2019t ever try to commit fraud on anyone; I was shocked by what happened this month.\u201d In a published DM exchange with a Vox reporter, he said he regretted filing for bankruptcy and thought that \u201cregulators make everything worse.\u201d\n\nSBF arrested\n\nBankman-Fried was arrested in December 2022 in the Bahamas, where FTX was based. He was then extradited to the U.S. to face a number of criminal charges. He was released on a $250 million bail bond, and he remained under house arrest at his parents\u2019 home in Palo Alto. This was revoked in August after he was accused of intimidating Alameda\u2019s former CEO, Caroline Ellison, by leaking her private diary.\n\nRay represented the company during a House Financial Services Committee hearing regarding FTX. When asked whether the firm had significant risk management systems, Ray said at the time that \u201cthere were virtually no internal controls and no separateness whatsoever\u201d and added that he did not \u201ctrust a single piece of paper\u201d in the exchange\u2019s organization. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams called Bankman-Fried\u2019s alleged crimes \u201cone of the biggest financial frauds in American history,\u201d in a press conference.\n\nThe aftermath\n\nFTX co-founder and former CTO Gary Wang, and Alameda Research\u2019s former CEO, Caroline Ellison, both pleaded guilty in December 2022 to federal criminal charges in relation to the FTX collapse. They\u2019re also facing civil penalties from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) alongside the criminal charges. Wang and Ellison plan to cooperate with prosecutors and will be major witnesses in the trial, given their close ties to Bankman-Fried, FTX and Alameda.\n\nIn January, Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to all counts, which include wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to misuse customer funds. He could face up to 115 years in jail if convicted on all charges.\n\nThe crypto industry as a whole suffered from FTX\u2019s collapse, which was the first of many. BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 in November 2022, as did Genesis Global Trading in January.\n\nWhere we are today\n\nBankman-Fried will be represented by Cohen & Gresser, and Mark Cohen, a high-profile defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, will be the lead attorney. If that name sounds familiar, it might be because he also represented Ghislaine Maxwell in her sex trafficking trial related to Jeffrey Epstein. He requested an early release for Bankman-Fried but was denied.\n\nWith the trial beginning, we\u2019re witnessing how FTX\u2019s story ends. But what\u2019s on our mind is what happens to the investors and creditors affected by the collapse? And what happens to the billions in crypto assets tied up in legal proceedings?"

        "body": "A judge ruled Tuesday that Donald Trump committed fraud for years while building the real estate empire that catapulted him to fame and the White House.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron, ruling in a civil lawsuit brought by New York\u2019s attorney general, found that the former president and his company deceived banks, insurers and others by massively overvaluing his assets and exaggerating his net worth on paperwork used in making deals and securing financing.\n\nEngoron ordered that some of Trump\u2019s business licenses be rescinded as punishment and said he would continue to have an independent monitor oversee the Trump Organization\u2019s operations.\n\nA Trump spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling. Trump has long insisted he did nothing wrong.\n\nThe decision, days before the start of a non-jury trial in Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 lawsuit, is the strongest repudiation yet of Trump\u2019s carefully coiffed image as a wealthy and shrewd real estate mogul turned political powerhouse.\n\nBeyond mere bragging about his riches, Trump, his company and key executives repeatedly lied about them on his annual financial statements, reaping rewards such as favorable loan terms and lower insurance premiums, Engoron found.\n\nThose tactics crossed a line and violated the law, the judge said, rejecting Trump\u2019s contention that a disclaimer on the financial statements absolved him of any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cIn defendants\u2019 world: rent regulated apartments are worth the same as unregulated apartments; restricted land is worth the same as unrestricted land; restrictions can evaporate into thin air; a disclaimer by one party casting responsibility on another party exonerates the other party\u2019s lies,\u201d Engoron wrote in his 35-page ruling. \u201cThat is a fantasy world, not the real world.\u201d\n\nManhattan prosecutors had looked into bringing a criminal case over the same conduct but declined to do so, leaving James to sue Trump and seek penalties that could disrupt his and his family\u2019s ability to do business in the state.\n\nEngoron\u2019s ruling, in a phase of the case known as summary judgment, resolves the key claim in James\u2019 lawsuit, but six others remain.\n\nEngoron is slated to hold a non-jury trial starting Oct. 2 before deciding on those claims and any punishments he may impose. James is seeking $250 million in penalties and a ban on Trump doing business in New York, his home state. The trial could last into December, Engoron has said.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers had asked the judge to throw out the case, which he denied. They contend that James wasn\u2019t legally allowed to file the lawsuit because there isn\u2019t any evidence that the public was harmed by Trump\u2019s actions. They also argued that many of the allegations in the lawsuit were barred by the statute of limitations.\n\nEngoron, noting that he had \u201cemphatically rejected\u201d those arguments earlier in the case, equated them to the \u201ctime-loop in the film \u2018Groundhog Day.'\u201d\n\nJames, a Democrat, sued Trump and the Trump Organization a year ago, alleging a pattern of duplicity that she dubbed \u201cthe art of the steal,\u201d a twist on the title of Trump\u2019s 1987 business memoir \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit accused Trump and his company of routinely inflating the value of assets like skyscrapers, golf courses and his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, padding his bottom line by billions.\n\nAmong the allegations were that Trump claimed his Trump Tower apartment in Manhattan \u2014 a three-story penthouse replete with gold-plated fixtures \u2014 was nearly three times its actual size and valued the property at $327 million. No apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount, James said.\n\nTrump valued Mar-a-Lago as high as $739 million \u2014 more than 10 times a more reasonable estimate of its worth. Trump\u2019s figure for the private club and residence was based on the idea that the property could be developed for residential use, but deed terms prohibit that, James said.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing, arguing in sworn testimony for the case that it didn\u2019t matter what he put on his financial statements because they have a disclaimer that says they shouldn\u2019t be trusted. He told James at the April deposition, \u201cYou don\u2019t have a case and you should drop this case.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know the banks were fully paid? Do you know the banks made a lot of money?\u201d Trump testified. \u201cDo you know I don\u2019t believe I ever got even a default notice, and even during COVID, the banks were all paid? And yet you\u2019re suing on behalf of banks, I guess. It\u2019s crazy. The whole case is crazy.\u201d\n\nEngoron rejected that argument when the defense previously sought to have the case thrown out.\n\nThe judge said the disclaimer on the financial statements \u201cmakes abundantly clear that Mr. Trump was fully responsible for the information contained within\u201d them and that \u201callowing blanket disclaimers to insulate liars from liability would completely undercut\u201d the \u201cimportant function\u201d that such statements serve \u201cin the real world.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019 lawsuit is one of several legal headaches for Trump as he campaigns for a return to the White House in 2024. He has been indicted four times in the last six months \u2014 accused in Georgia and Washington, D.C., of plotting to overturn his 2020 election loss, in Florida of hoarding classified documents, and in Manhattan of falsifying business records related to hush money paid on his behalf.\n\nThe Trump Organization was convicted of tax fraud last year in an unrelated criminal case for helping executives dodge taxes on extravagant perks such as Manhattan apartments and luxury cars. The company was fined $1.6 million. One of the executives, Trump\u2019s longtime finance chief Allen Weisselberg, pleaded guilty and served five months in jail. He is a defendant in James\u2019 lawsuit and gave sworn deposition testimony for the case in May.\n\nJames\u2019 lawsuit does not carry the potential of prison time, but could complicate his ability to transact real estate deals. It could also stain his legacy as a developer.\n\nJames has asked Engoron to ban Trump and his three eldest children from ever again running a company based New York. She also wants Trump and the Trump Organization barred from entering into commercial real estate acquisitions for five years, among other sanctions. The $250 million in penalties she is seeking is the estimated worth of benefits derived from the alleged fraud, she said.\n\nJames, who campaigned for office as a Trump critic and watchdog, started scrutinizing his business practices in March 2019 after his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen testified to Congress that Trump exaggerated his wealth on financial statements provided to Deutsche Bank while trying to obtain financing to buy the NFL\u2019s Buffalo Bills.\n\nJames\u2019 office previously sued Trump for misusing his own charitable foundation to further his political and business interests. Trump was ordered to pay $2 million to an array of charities as a fine and the charity, the Trump Foundation, was shut down."

        "body": "Thousands of pages of exhibits detailing the performance of his assets made available during the trial have provided a deeper look into his fortune. The former president\u2019s 2021 statement of financial condition, filed as part of the lawsuit, pegged his net worth at $US4.5 billion. Bloomberg\u2019s calculation has consistently been below Trump\u2019s figures. At the same time, Bloomberg measured the value of some Trump properties higher than what New York state claims. Trump took the stand and testified that the properties whose values he\u2019s accused of inflating were actually undervalued, based on the premium his \u201cbrand\u201d adds. He also said that banks didn\u2019t rely on his statements of financial condition when weighing loans. \u201cThey just weren\u2019t a very important element in banks\u2019 decision-making process,\u201d Trump told the court. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll explain that as this trial goes along.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at New York state\u2019s valuation of four high-profile Trump properties where the prosecution alleges fraud occurred, along with Bloomberg\u2019s own approach to assessing the assets.\n\nMar-a-Lago Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US612.1 million , Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US240 million, New York\u2019s valuation (2021): $US27.6 million It\u2019s fair to say that Trump\u2019s most famous property these days is no longer New York\u2019s Trump Tower but his Mar-a-Lago Club, the historic Palm Beach estate built by Marjorie Merriweather Post in the 1920s that he now calls home. New York\u2019s valuation of Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate has raised eyebrows. Credit: AP The sprawling resort has been at the centre of some publicised post-presidency scandals, from classified documents being kept in one of its bathrooms to the location where Trump is said to have shared nuclear submarine secrets with Australian businessman Anthony Pratt \u2014 something that Trump denies.\n\nIt\u2019s also a major focus in Trump\u2019s fraud lawsuit. Trump made a series of agreements with Palm Beach County and the National Trust for Historic Preservation for Mar-a-Lago to be used only as a club, giving up any development rights. Consequently, Palm Beach values the property as a business on its tax rolls. In 2021, the county assessed it at $US27.6 million, lower than comparable residential properties. New York State argues that this appraisal is the one Trump should have been using. New York\u2019s estimated value \u201cwas a shock to the real estate community and anybody with any understanding of the island and its values,\u201d said Liza Pulitzer, a real estate agent at Brown Harris Stevens and a Palm Beach native. \u201cIt could easily fetch $US500 million or more.\u201d\n\nThat assumes a buyer views it as a single-family residence. It\u2019s currently not zoned for such use, though Trump is able to reside there through a loophole designating himself an employee. Trump\u2019s legal team engaged an expert witness who argued that a future buyer could do the same thing. And if they didn\u2019t like the idea of sharing their property with others, they could reduce the club to a membership of one. Still, it\u2019s unclear if Palm Beach would allow that without a change to its zoning status. Historically, Mar-a-Lago never made much money for the Trump Organisation, but that seems to be changing. It took in about $US41 million in revenue last year, according to Trump\u2019s most recent ethics disclosure, compared with $US21 million in 2019. Bloomberg values Mar-a-Lago at $US240 million, based on a combination of comparable residential property sales in the area as well as its value as a business, reflecting some uncertainty around its future status. That uncertainty isn\u2019t shared by everyone. If the city and county allowed it, \u201cthere is no reason why it wouldn\u2019t be able to converted to a full-time private residence,\u201d said Eli Beracha, director of the Hollo School of Real Estate at Florida International University.\n\nTrump\u2019s Fifth Avenue penthouse Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US131.3 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US40 million, New York valuation: No current estimate available Trump\u2019s penthouse apartment at Trump Tower has been an integral part of his image for 40 years, so it\u2019s not surprising that one of the world\u2019s masters of hyperbole exaggerated its size for most of that time. Trump\u2019s penthouse apartment at Trump Tower has been an integral part of his image for 40 years. Credit: AP Between 2011 and 2016, Trump valued his apartment based on it being 30,000 square feet (2,787 square metres) in size \u2014 almost triple its actual measurement of 10,996 square feet. Because of this, New York State arrived at a valuation that was about a third of Trump\u2019s in those years. They haven\u2019t provided a more recent estimate.\n\nSpace inflation wasn\u2019t the only issue. Between 2014 and 2015, Trump increased the value of the apartment to $US327 million from $US200 million. The prosecution argues that was to mask a drop in the value of one of his other properties. \u201cA discrepancy of this order of magnitude, by a real estate developer sizing up his own living space of decades, can only be considered fraud,\u201d Judge Arthur Engoron wrote in a September ruling. \u2018The company has never been stronger and never been better.\u2019 Eric Trump Bloomberg values the property using recent Trump Tower sales, as well as those of comparable Manhattan penthouses. While some splashy residences in much newer buildings on so-called Billionaires Row have listed for well in excess of $US100 million, they typically boast higher ceilings, more up-to-date finishes, contemporary layouts, outdoor space and better views. A better comparison would be a 9450-square-foot penthouse in Olympic Tower, five blocks south on Fifth Avenue, which has been on and off the market for $US35 million since 2016. Then there\u2019s Carl Icahn\u2019s 14,000-square-foot penthouse at Museum Tower on West 53rd Street. It was listed for $US35 million in 2019 before he attempted to split the space and sell it as two separate apartments. Both were eventually delisted.\n\nIt\u2019s possible Trump would get a higher price because of his name. \u201cThere would be a Trump premium because the person that would want that property is likely to be a Trump supporter,\u201d Beracha said. But it\u2019s also likely that the association with Trump would turn off some buyers. Trump Park Avenue Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US90.9 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US86.4 million, New York\u2019s valuation (2021): $US80 million The residential condo tower on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, formerly the Hotel Delmonico, isn\u2019t one of Trump\u2019s best-known buildings, but it\u2019s been the source of some significant asset inflations, according to the prosecution.\n\nIts value to Trump mostly stems from unsold condo units that are owned by the Trump Organisation and rented out. A varying number have been rent-stabilised, meaning tenants pay below market rates. Typically, these apartments are valued at a discount because tenants can stay indefinitely, sometimes even passing them on to children. In 2010, 12 rent-stabilised apartments owned by Trump were valued at an average of $US62,500 each in an appraisal provided by a real estate company. The following year, Trump valued them at $US4.1 million each \u2014 more than 65 times greater. Trump has continued to value stabilised apartments in the building at market rates, including in his 2021 statement of financial condition. Rent-stabilised units \u201cwith a positive cash flow are often valued at 15-25 cents a dollar of the open market value, versus single digits for negative cash flow,\u201d said Jonathan Miller, president of appraiser Miller Samuel. Still, Trump\u2019s optimism was shown to be at least partially justified. By 2021, only five of the 12 apartments remained rent stabilised. The prosecution also claims two additional non-stabilised apartments in the building were overvalued because Trump ignored an option his daughter, Ivanka Trump, had to buy them at a price lower than the market value he used.\n\n40 Wall Street Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US664 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US270 million, New York\u2019s valuation: No current estimate available In valuing his flagship lower Manhattan office tower, Trump consistently ignored more conservative appraisals he\u2019d received from professionals, New York State argues. Trump has been accused of significantly over-valuing his flagship downtown New York property. Credit: Bloomberg For example, 40 Wall Street was appraised by a real estate company at $US200 million in 2011 and $US220 million in 2012. Despite this, Trump valued the property in financial statements at $US524.7 million and $US527.2 million, respectively, for those years.\n\nBloomberg uses a capitalisation of net income approach in coming up with an estimate. Valuations for commercial offices across the board have taken a hit in the past 18 months amid rising interest rates and a lacklustre corporate leasing market. But 40 Wall Street has its own unique problems. Tenant departures meant occupancy slid to 77 per cent in June, down from 98 per cent in 2015. Its net operating income is only 61 per cent of what was projected by underwriters. Loading \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of leasing velocity down there,\u201d said Albert Sultan, a broker at Kassin Sabbagh Realty. The financial district used to offer a lower cost for tenants, but with Midtown rents declining, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to go downtown.\u201d The property is also subject to a ground lease that resets in 2032 at either 6 per cent of the land value or 85 per cent of its rent in the prior year. Based on current rent, that means the ground lease would jump to $US30 million from about $US2.6 million now."

        "body": "ChatGPT-maker Open AI said Friday it has pushed out its co-founder and CEO Sam Altman after a review found he was \u201cnot consistently candid in his communications\u201d with the board of directors.\n\n\u201cThe board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI,\u201d the artificial intelligence company said in a statement.\n\nIn the year since Altman catapulted ChatGPT to global fame, he has become Silicon Valley\u2019s sought-after voice on the promise and potential dangers of artificial intelligence and his sudden and mostly unexplained exit brought uncertainty to the industry\u2019s future.\n\nMira Murati, OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer, will take over as interim CEO effective immediately, the company said, while it searches for a permanent replacement.\n\nThe announcement also said another OpenAI co-founder and top executive, Greg Brockman, the board\u2019s chairman, would step down from that role but remain at the company, where he serves as president. But later on X, formerly Twitter, Brockman posted a message he sent to OpenAI employees in which he wrote, \u201cbased on today\u2019s news, i quit.\u201d\n\nIn another X post on Friday night, Brockman said Altman was asked to join a video meeting at noon Friday with the company\u2019s board members, minus Brockman, during which OpenAI co-founder and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever informed Altman he was being fired.\n\n\u201cSam and I are shocked and saddened by what the board did today,\u201d Brockman wrote, adding that he was informed of his removal from the board in a separate call with Sutskever a short time later.\n\nOpenAI declined to answer questions on what Altman\u2019s alleged lack of candor was about. The statement said his behavior was hindering the board\u2019s ability to exercise its responsibilities.\n\nAltman posted Friday on X: \u201ci loved my time at openai. it was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. most of all i loved working with such talented people. will have more to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement allowing OpenAI access to part of the AP\u2019s text archives.\n\nAltman helped start OpenAI as a nonprofit research laboratory in 2015. But it was ChatGPT\u2019s explosion into public consciousness that thrust Altman into the spotlight as a face of generative AI \u2014 technology that can produce novel imagery, passages of text and other media. On a world tour this year, he was mobbed by a crowd of adoring fans at an event in London.\n\nHe\u2019s sat with multiple heads of state to discuss AI\u2019s potential and perils. Just Thursday, he took part in a CEO summit at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in San Francisco, where OpenAI is based.\n\nHe predicted AI will prove to be \u201cthe greatest leap forward of any of the big technological revolutions we\u2019ve had so far.\u201d He also acknowledged the need for guardrails, calling attention to the existential dangers future AI could pose.\n\nSome computer scientists have criticized that focus on far-off risks as distracting from the real-world limitations and harms of current AI products. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has launched an investigation into whether OpenAI violated consumer protection laws by scraping public data and publishing false information through its chatbot.\n\nThe company said its board consists of OpenAI\u2019s chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, and three non-employees: Quora CEO Adam D\u2019Angelo, tech entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, and Helen Toner of the Georgetown Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s key business partner, Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars into the startup and helped provide the computing power to run its AI systems, said that the transition won\u2019t affect its relationship.\n\n\u201cWe have a long-term partnership with OpenAI and Microsoft remains committed to Mira and their team as we bring this next era of AI to our customers,\u201d said an emailed Microsoft statement.\n\nWhile not trained as an AI engineer, Altman, now 38, has been seen as a Silicon Valley wunderkind since his early 20s. He was recruited in 2014 to take lead of the startup incubator YCombinator.\n\n\u201cSam is one of the smartest people I know, and understands startups better than perhaps anyone I know, including myself,\u201d read YCombinator co-founder Paul Graham\u2019s 2014 announcement that Altman would become its president. Graham said at the time that Altman was \u201cone of those rare people who manage to be both fearsomely effective and yet fundamentally benevolent.\u201d\n\nOpenAI started out as a nonprofit when it launched with financial backing from Tesla CEO Elon Musk and others. Its stated aims were to \u201cadvance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.\u201d\n\nThat changed in 2018 when it incorporated a for-profit business Open AI LP, and shifted nearly all its staff into the business, not long after releasing its first generation of the GPT large language model for mimicking human writing. Around the same time, Musk, who had co-chaired its board with Altman, resigned from the board in a move that OpenAI said would eliminate a \u201cpotential future conflict for Elon\u201d due to Tesla\u2019s work on building self-driving systems.\n\nWhile OpenAI\u2019s board has preserved its nonprofit governance structure, the startup it oversees has increasingly sought to capitalize on its technology by tailoring its popular chatbot to business customers.\n\nAt its first developer conference last week, Altman was the main speaker showcasing a vision for a future of AI agents that could help people with a variety of tasks. Days later, he announced the company would have to pause new subscriptions to its premium version of ChatGPT because it had exceeded capacity.\n\nAltman\u2019s exit \u201cis indeed shocking as he has been the face of\u201d generative AI technology, said Gartner analyst Arun Chandrasekaran.\n\nHe said OpenAI still has a \u201cdeep bench of technical leaders\u201d but its next executives will have to steer it through the challenges of scaling the business and meeting the expectations of regulators and society.\n\nForrester analyst Rowan Curran speculated that Altman\u2019s departure, \u201cwhile sudden,\u201d did not likely reflect deeper business problems.\n\n\u201cThis seems to be a case of an executive transition that was about issues with the individual in question, and not with the underlying technology or business,\u201d Curran said.\n\nAltman has a number of possible next steps. Even while running OpenAI, he placed large bets on several other ambitious projects.\n\nAmong them are Helion Energy, for developing fusion reactors that could produce prodigious amounts of energy from the hydrogen in seawater, and Retro Biosciences, which aims to add 10 years to the human lifespan using biotechnology. Altman also co-founded Worldcoin, a biometric and cryptocurrency project that\u2019s been scanning people\u2019s eyeballs with the goal of creating a vast digital identity and financial network.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press business writers Haleluya Hadero in New York, Kelvin Chan in London and Michael Liedtke and David Hamilton in San Francisco contributed to this report."

        "body": "In perhaps the most unexpected tech news of the year, billionaire and AI evangelist Sam Altman has been ejected from his CEO role at OpenAI by the company\u2019s board after an apparent vote of no confidence. Its exact wording in a release issued this afternoon: Altman\u2019s \u201cdeparture follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.\u201d\n\nWhat the hell is happening at the most hyped company in the world?! Here are some totally speculative theories that occurred to us and others around the web.\n\n1. Did Altman circumvent the board in a major deal?\n\nBased on the board\u2019s language and the way these giant tech companies work, this is the prevailing theory floating around right now. \u201cNot consistently candid\u201d is a very diplomatic way of saying Altman lied.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Altman \u2014 and potentially OpenAI President Greg Brockman, who stepped down as chairman simultaneously, then resigned \u2014 wanted to make a bold move that he knew the board would not like. It\u2019s not uncommon for these deals to be hammered out quietly in smoke- (or vape-) filled rooms and then presented as a fait accompli, but if it was controversial enough and the board found out about these maneuvers, it could be fuel for an ouster.\n\nBut what kind of deal would be big and dangerous enough for a summary dismissal of the CEO and famous face of the company? The man was onstage two weeks ago; I just talked with him! What could have happened since then?\n\nFew would be shocked if Microsoft, which is deeply, deeply embedded in OpenAI as an investor and customer, is a factor here. Could Altman have been working with \u2014 or against \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s patron in secret? If Altman wanted to kill the golden goose by going independent, that might have activated the board\u2019s fiduciary or otherwise statutory duty. On the other hand, if he was negotiating some other deal, like an acquisition or deeper and more exclusive integration, it could also have caused the board to bristle, either at the idea itself or at being excluded.\n\nBut if Microsoft was as shocked as the rest of us, as one report has it, it could hardly be the kind of high-stakes conspiracy some seem to be hoping for. But one must assume that Microsoft would say that either way. Even if they\u2019d been working with Altman on some kind of secret plan, they can truthfully say they were surprised by his firing. (And they \u201cremain committed to our partnership.\u201d)\n\n2. Do they disagree on long-term strategy?\n\nDespite being the hottest tech company in the world right now and everyone talking about ChatGPT, OpenAI isn\u2019t exactly a sound business. It\u2019s shoveling money into the furnace as fast as it can by serving, by all accounts, a fantastically expensive product at bargain-bin prices.\n\nThat\u2019s all well and good for a year or two, but at some point that strategy changes from a growth hack to an existential liability. Could Altman and the board have had irreconcilable differences on where that point lies?\n\nThis doesn\u2019t seem so likely. The company has been very deliberately pursuing this very publicly, confidently and on a long-term basis. Altman and the board seem to be in sync on this, at least for the present.\n\n3. Do the numbers not add up?\n\nOn the other hand, could OpenAI be losing even more money than Altman admitted or projected? It seems impossible, but the costs of running this operation have no precedent, nor really does the operation itself.\n\nOr what if, and again this is purely speculation, Altman has been secretly pursuing an internal project, perhaps at significant cost, against the advice of the board and without the necessary safety measures that probably should accompany such research? It sounds a little wild, but firing your CEO like this is also a little wild.\n\nSome kind of major mismatch in the financial department could be cause for dismissal, but it\u2019s hard to imagine what Altman could have kept from the board and CTO that would be so damning.\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility that Altman was making personal investments in a way that the board disagreed with. With OpenAI poised to be a kingmaker in the field, he would certainly be in a position of power. One would think that, as an ideologically driven person already rich beyond belief and at the head of the world\u2019s leading AI company, Altman would have risen beyond having to do this kind of side deal, or at the very least that scrutiny on him and those close to him would prevent them. But one can never be sure.\n\n4. Could it be a major security or privacy incident?\n\nThe idea that the company has experienced a major, perhaps pervasive, security issue is bolstered by the fact that Microsoft reportedly suspended use of ChatGPT internally a few days ago. OpenAI subsequently stopped allowing new signups. If there was a serious security problem in its biggest product and Altman downplayed it, that would obviously create distrust with the board.\n\nThere is also the potential for misuse at scale with the enormous amount of personal data that travels through OpenAI\u2019s APIs and services.\n\nWorking against this theory is the fact that CTO Mira Murati was just elevated to interim CEO in Altman\u2019s place. It seems unlikely that anything security-related would go through the CEO and not the CTO, or that the two would be at odds to the point where one could be fired like this and the other swapped in to clean up the mess. As the board\u2019s statement notes, Murati is in charge of product and safety, among other things. Any significant snafu in that department would reflect on her, as well as Altman.\n\n5. Perhaps a difference of AI ethics or philosophy?\n\nAltman is a proud techno-optimist, and often speaks fondly of the possibilities of AGI, or artificial general intelligence, a theoretical software system that achieves human-like intellect and versatility.\n\nThe board\u2019s statement pointedly includes that \u201cOpenAI was deliberately structured to advance our mission: to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all humanity\u201d and that new leadership was necessary. It\u2019s possible that Sam\u2019s zeal for AGI, even absent a secret project or agreement, led to a major rift between him and the board.\n\nIt\u2019s been obvious to all that Altman took the company in a much more corporate direction from its origins, changing its legal status and aggressively pursuing enterprise and consumer applications. That doesn\u2019t sound a lot like the \u201cmission\u201d the board wants to advance. Then again, this shift didn\u2019t happen today, and it certainly doesn\u2019t seem like a plausible reason for abruptly firing the CEO and a few others on a beautiful fall Friday afternoon.\n\n6. What about IP and legal liability?\n\nAltman told me at OpenAI\u2019s Dev Day earlier this month that the company doesn\u2019t want to incur any copyright problems by using (as I had asked about) datasets of pirated books. But a lot of research I\u2019ve been reading contradicts that, as does pretty much every AI data scientist I talk to. It\u2019s exceedingly hard to imagine that OpenAI built GPT-3 with the copyrighted books database (as seems to be the case) but not GPT-4 or succeeding models. (I was going to write this up next week, so thanks OpenAI board for eating my lunch.)\n\nIf you were the board and facing the mounting accusations that your product was built on a dataset that includes thousands or millions of copyrighted works \u2014 and your CEO had systematically downplayed the potential liability there \u2014 how would you feel? I\u2019d feel very hurt.\n\nBut again, if copyright liability was the reason, it seems unlikely that the board would promote the CTO. Presumably, OpenAI\u2019s Chief Science Officer Ilya Sutskever would also have been in the know, and he\u2019s still on the board.\n\n7. Did CTO Mira Murati launch a coup?\n\nProbably not \u2014 she seems cool, and anyway what CTO wants to be CEO? Mira, answer my email!\n\n8. Was it a \u201cpersonal matter\u201d?\n\nWhen someone is kicked out in a hurry, it\u2019s not uncommon that there was some kind of unprofessional behavior in the workplace. Some CEOs get a pass on things like having kids with direct reports, but not all.\n\nAltman also has three siblings, and his younger sister Annie has publicly accused him of abuse. We have no way of evaluating these allegations, which involve private matters.\n\nOur read on the board\u2019s language in dismissing Altman, however, is that it was not a legal or personal problem that provoked the action, but a professional or business one.\n\nWe probably won\u2019t know the full truth on this for a long time, as the characters in the drama are likely to be NDA\u2019ed up. Per various whispers and leaks, an all-hands meeting about the situation this afternoon didn\u2019t produce any revelations beyond banal reassurances that the company is fine and they\u2019ll get a fresh CEO soon. Expect to hear a lot of rumors before we hear the real thing."

        "body": "Welcome back to The Interchange, where we take a look at the hottest fintech news of the previous week. If you want to receive The Interchange directly in your inbox every Sunday, head here to sign up! After a bit of a quiet period, things in the world of fintech picked up in a big way this past week. We wrote about some notable fundraises, how PayPal was hit with an antitrust lawsuit, how Bolt is trying to move on after an SEC probe, and much more.\n\nRainforest takes on the bigger players\n\nIt\u2019s not every day that we\u2019re pitched companies that feel like they are taking on bigger players in a really meaningful way. This past week, I wrote about Rainforest, an Atlanta-based startup that is taking on incumbents such as Fiserv and FIS, as well as trying to take market share from other fintechs such as Stripe with its offering. Rainforest works with software companies to help them embed financial services and payments into their platforms. In an interview with TechCrunch, CEO and co-founder Joshua Silver respectfully disagreed with a16z general partner Angela Strange about her 2019 statement that every company would become a fintech. In his view, most software companies don\u2019t actually want to be fintechs and deal with all the regulatory and compliance issues that go with that. They really just want to be able to accept payments and generate more revenue from being able to do so.\n\nAccel led the company\u2019s $8.5 million seed round, which included participation from Infinity Ventures, BoxGroup, The Fintech Fund, Tech Square Ventures, and Ardent Venture Partners.\n\nIt\u2019s always cool to see startups outside the coasts growing, and Silver\u2019s confidence that what Rainforest is building will make it a formidable player in the space feels like it has merit. Founded in 2022, the startup has seen impressive growth in a short period of time, securing client commitments representing more than $500 million in processing, with much of the volume guaranteed.\n\nSilver believes the company\u2019s exclusive focus on software companies only gives it an edge.\n\n\u201cNone of the modern processors were built specifically for software platforms. Most of them were built directly for merchants, and they\u2019ve all had to retrofit their platforms even to accommodate basic payment processing and reporting functions for software companies,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\n\nAs such, the startup is capturing volume as software platforms migrate from legacy processors such as Fiserv and FIS. As that happens, it competes against companies like Stripe (and its Connect product) to embed financial services and payments.\n\nNik Milanovi\u0107 of The Fintech Fund posted on X that he believes that one of the biggest stories of the next decade will be about Stripe, \u201cwhich looks invincible from the outside, losing market share to nimble competitors.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI think Rainforest is going to be a big part of that story.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Infinity Ventures\u2019 Jeremy Jonker and former PayPal exec said he\u2019s been in payments for 13 years and has \u201cnever before seen anything like Rainforest.\u201d He told me via email that \u201cJoshua\u2019s background as a software platform founder and then as a payments consultant is a big part of the secret sauce. He\u2019s lived the pain of payments himself, and you can\u2019t underestimate the power of being in your clients\u2019 shoes. He knew that taking on risk and compliance burdens, and offering features like data portability, would be hugely attractive to platforms. We also like that it\u2019s not just him who has a wealth of payments experience \u2014 it\u2019s the entire team he\u2019s recruited to the company. Many are longtime payments and SaaS vets who knew there was so much potential for a better provider, and now they\u2019ve built it themselves.\u201d\n\nListen to TC+ editor Alex Wilhelm and I talk more about how there\u2019s plenty of market share to go around in Friday\u2019s episode of the Equity podcast below. \u2014 Mary Ann\n\nPayPal is being sued for alleged \u201cDraconian\u201d payment policies\n\nOn October 5, Mary Ann broke the news that PayPal has been hit with a class action lawsuit by consumers represented by law firm Hagens Berman alleging that the fintech giant\u2019s anti-steering rules stifle competition against lower-cost payment platforms such as Stripe and Shopify. Specifically, according to an investigation conducted by the firm\u2019s consumer rights attorneys, PayPal has subjected consumers to excess charges when purchasing from online merchants that accept PayPal or Venmo.\n\nSomeone commented on social media that they didn\u2019t see the problem with what PayPal is doing and questioned whether or not Visa and Mastercard do the same thing. So I went back to the attorneys who filed the lawsuit, who noted that the \u201canti-steering rules\u201d are not the first of their kind. They said: \u201cVisa and MasterCard once imposed similar anti-steering rules on merchants accepting their cards but, after the Justice Department sued the networks for antitrust violations, they agreed in 2010 to eliminate their anti-steering rules as part of the settlement. With payments transitioning into the digital realm, PayPal has simply ripped a page right from the Visa and MasterCard [sic] playbook.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Patrick McGahan, a partner at Scott+Scott who focuses on antitrust litigation, had an interesting take that actually involves both of those card giants. He told TechCrunch that the case illustrates that \u201cthe tensions between merchants and the payment system providers are not over, and that litigation regarding this key cost faced by merchants is likely to continue for some time.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cPlatform companies that operate as gatekeepers in their market, such as PayPal, will continue to be the subject of antitrust litigation as a result of the significant fees they charge. PayPal\u2019s fees are, however, driven by the costs imposed upon them by the dominant card schemes, Visa, Mastercard and American Express. So, we can expect PayPal will respond to this suit by arguing that it is as much of a price taker as the merchants themselves, and that the terms imposed upon it by the card schemes drive some of its anti-steering rules.\u201d\n\nPayPal did not respond to requests for comment. \u2014 Mary Ann\n\nBolt CEO gets frank about SEC probe\n\nBolt Financial CEO Maju Kuruvilla told me in an interview that the one-click checkout company is putting a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe behind it and is moving on.\n\n\u201cIt obviously is a very, very involved process, but we\u2019re really happy to put that behind us,\u201d Kuruvilla told TechCrunch. \u201cWe look forward to focusing on the momentum for the business and how we can help the retailers, especially the big retailers who are looking to us to innovate for them, because this is a tough year for retailers.\u201d\n\nYou might remember that Bolt, which provides checkout technology to merchants, and its co-founder Ryan Breslow, were subpoenaed last year by the SEC to investigate whether the company violated any securities laws during fundraising in 2021 when Bolt was seeking its $355 million Series E round that valued the company at $11 billion.\n\nThe investigation took about 15 months, but news of that probe didn\u2019t go public until July of 2023. Shortly thereafter on August 23, the SEC said, in a letter viewed by TechCrunch, it was not recommending an enforcement action for the company.\n\nKuruvilla spoke with me about how, exactly, the company can put something like this behind it, what it told customers and what\u2019s next.

        "body": "In the runup to the 2020 election, a small news organization saw an opportunity.\n\nThe Epoch Times directed millions of dollars in advertising toward supporting President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and published dozens of articles parroting his lies about the election \u2014 resulting in huge growth to its audience and its coffers.\n\nThe strategy garnered criticism from fact-checking groups and got it banned from advertising on Facebook, but it ultimately paid off \u2014 putting the once-fringe newspaper on a path that perhaps only its leader, who claims to have supernatural powers, could have foreseen.\n\nToday, The Epoch Times is one of the country\u2019s most successful and influential conservative news organizations. It\u2019s powered by Falun Gong, a religious group persecuted in China, which launched The Epoch Times as a free propaganda newsletter more than two decades ago to oppose the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nFunded through aggressive online and real-world marketing campaigns and big-money conservative donors, The Epoch Times now boasts to be the country\u2019s fourth-largest newspaper by subscriber count. (Unlike most major newspapers, The Epoch Times isn't audited by the two major independent collectors of circulation data.) The nonprofit has amassed a fortune, growing its revenue by a staggering 685% in two years, to $122 million in 2021, according to the group\u2019s most recent tax records.\n\nIts editorial vision \u2014 fueled by a right-wing slant and conspiracy theories \u2014 is on display in recent reports on how \u201cJan. 6 Capitol Hill Security Footage Challenges Key Narratives\u201d and \u201cMeteorologists, Scientists Explain Why There Is \u2018No Climate Emergency.\u2019\u201d Its video series include a documentary-style film alleging widespread vaccine injury and death and an expos\u00e9 of an alleged world government agenda to harm farmers, cull the population and force survivors to eat bugs.\n\nWhat The Epoch Times lacks in standards, it makes up for in style and form, mirroring the aesthetics of journalism \u2014 a feature that\u2019s attracted subscribers and big-name supporters.\n\nAnti-vaccine activist and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. calls The Epoch Times a daily read, among his most trusted news sources. \u201cThey have a real bias against China, but on other reporting, they\u2019re very courageous and it\u2019s real journalism,\u201d Kennedy said in an interview with NBC News this summer.\n\nIn July, Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., recited the history of The Epoch Times into the congressional record. \u201cThis is all about one word: freedom,\u201d Norman said.\n\nThe Epoch Times has yet to throw its weight behind a candidate for 2024, but heading into the election cycle, it is moving into new and bigger office spaces and production studios in California, hiring mainstream news veterans who are not affiliated with Falun Gong, and revving up an ad-buying blitz.\n\n\u201cThey achieved the goal,\u201d said Brendan Steinhauser, a Texas-based Republican strategist hired by The Epoch Times in 2018 to open doors to conservative politicians and players. Steinhauser said that a series of interviews and introductions with politicians and media figures at that year\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference offered access to a wider conservative audience. The Epoch Times was a \u201csupporting sponsor\u201d for this year\u2019s conference.\n\n\u201cThey take advantage of every opportunity,\u201d Steinhauser, who is not currently working for The Epoch Times, continued. \u201cThey studied digital marketing. They learned how to work the system. And they did it. They're smarter than people give them credit for, and they\u2019ve got the money to back it up.\u201d\n\nAs a nonprofit, The Epoch Times is exempt from most federal taxes. Its mission, according to tax filings, is independent journalism, \u201coutside of political interests and the pursuit of profit, for the public benefit and to be truly responsible to society.\u201d\n\nNeither the chairman nor the editor-in-chief of The Epoch Times returned multiple requests for comment. Representatives for The Epoch Times have previously defended it against critical reporting, labeling reports of the paper\u2019s conservative mission, and its penchant for misinformation, \u201csmears.\u201d\n\nEpoch Times representatives also deny an affiliation with Falun Gong, despite the two groups\u2019 clear financial and organizational ties: The Epoch Times board members and most staff are Falun Gong practitioners. The nonprofits behind The Epoch Times and Friends of Falun Gong, the movement\u2019s advocacy organization, share executives and provide grants and services to each other, according to tax filings. And the newspaper, along with a digital production company and the heavily advertised dance troupe Shen Yun, make up a nonprofit network that the leader of the religious movement calls \u201cour media.\u201d\n\nLi Hongzhi during an interview in New York in 1999. Henny Ray Abrams / AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn 2009, Li Hongzhi came to speak to his followers, volunteers who worked at The Epoch Times\u2019 offices in Manhattan. Li\u2019s instructions for the group were simple. They needed to reach people outside of the Falun Gong religious community. And they needed to make money. A lot of it.\n\n\u201cEnsure that the paper gains a foothold in ordinary society and turns profitable,\u201d Li said.\n\nFalun Gong \u2014 or Falun Dafa, as some followers call it \u2014 is a kind of personal development movement started by Li in China in 1992. It combines tenets of Buddhism and Taoism, and followers practice with meditation and flowing breath and movement exercises, and by studying Li\u2019s teachings.\n\nTo his followers, Li is a God-like figure who can levitate, walk through walls and see into the future. His ultra-conservative and controversial teachings include a rejection of modern science, art and medicine, and a denunciation of homosexuality, feminism and general worldliness.\n\nIn 1999, after thousands of Li\u2019s followers silently protested its repression in Beijing, China banned it altogether. Labeling it a cult, the Chinese government confiscated Falun Gong books, blocked websites, closed teaching centers and arrested practitioners. Human rights groups reported a brutal crackdown: Some adherents were sent to labor camps; others were tortured and killed.\n\nFalun Gong followers meditate outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington in 1999. Joyce Naltchayan / AFP via Getty Images file\n\nInternational human rights organizations condemned China\u2019s attempted eradication. In the U.S., where Li and some of his practitioners had fled, a new collection of followers organized a campaign to raise awareness and sympathy with parades, demonstrations and pamphlets that touted the benefits of Falun Gong and the brutality of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nThe Epoch Times was born out of that leafleting campaign. Started in Georgia in 2000 by John Tang, a Falun Gong practitioner who remains its CEO, in essence it was a Chinese-language public relations newsletter. The group\u2019s long-term goals were ambitious: to expose the Chinese Communist Party and to save the world in a supernatural war against communism.\n\nThrough the early aughts, The Epoch Times grew from an online effort to a weekly physical newspaper, with a home base in New York and a TV production company, New Tang Dynasty Television. It raised money from followers and was staffed by unpaid volunteers. It ran aggregated articles on international issues from Voice of America next to Thanksgiving Day explainers, dispatches from Falun Gong parades, and expos\u00e9s on atrocities alleged to have been committed by the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nBy 2019, it had gone mostly digital and was spending millions of dollars on creating a network of Facebook pages and groups and running aggressive pro-Trump ad campaigns. The move toward explicit support of Republicans, despite Li\u2019s teachings to stay away from U.S. politics, was foreshadowed by Li\u2019s comments at a Falun Gong conference a year before.\n\nLi said that Falun Gong\u2019s media ought to put a \u201cconstructive\u201d spin on the news, to advance the group\u2019s aims. It wasn\u2019t wrong, he said, to favorably cover a politician who shared Falun Gong\u2019s conservative values and whose goals aligned with their own.\n\n\u201cIf someone comes along now who can help to halt the downward spiral that the world is in, then he is truly someone extraordinary!\u201d Li said. \u201cHe would in effect be helping us! Wouldn\u2019t he be helping us to save people?\u201d\n\nThe Epoch Times also employed a tactic more often associated with fake news content farms and scammers than news organizations, creating a network of inspiring and cute-content pages and fake accounts to inflate The Epoch Times' reach.\n\nIn 2019, following reporting by NBC News, Facebook found that The Epoch Times had \u201cleveraged foreign actors posing as Americans to push political content\u201d and banned it from future advertising, citing a violation of policies, including trying to circumvent review systems.\n\nUndeterred, The Epoch Times pivoted to video, specifically YouTube, spending millions on internet-infamous ads featuring Roman Balmakov, a former Epoch Times delivery person who now hosts the online show Facts Matter. In the ads, Balmakov rails against the mainstream media, communism and the persecution of Trump.\n\nThe Epoch Times also revisited a tried-and-true strategy that the original anti-communism newspaper had been built on \u2014 free physical copies. Instead of boxes on street corners, this time The Epoch Times printed and distributed unsolicited special editions of the paper from California to the Carolinas to the U.K. In Philadelphia alone in 2020, the company mailed 280,000 free copies of its newspaper, \u201cto increase subscription,\u201d according to tax documents.\n\nThe aggressive online and real-life marketing campaigns paid off. The group reported $76 million in subscription revenue in 2021, compared to nearly $7 million in 2019. A former employee of a regional Epoch Times operation who asked not to be identified because he feared retribution said that in order to send the papers to the most likely customers, they bought lists of addresses from data brokers, specifically for conservatives aged 60 and over. And many of the new subscribers are seniors, according to an employee\u2019s account shared at a Falun Gong conference.\n\nBut hundreds of online complaints suggest that not all of the new customers are satisfied.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the terrible misfortune of being subscribed to the Epoch Times without my consent,\u201d one reads. Another says: \u201cI want to stop receiving Epoch Times emails. That is all I want.\u201d\n\nThe Epoch Times print newspaper in Augusta, Ga., in 2020. Elijah Nouvelage / Bloomberg via Getty Images file\n\nAs The Epoch Times\u2019 marketing strategy shifted, so did the content \u2014 and by 2020, it became a megaphone for the U.S.\u2019s most extreme right-wing stories.\n\nThere was plenty to write about: An election marred by disinformation, the bubbling culture wars and, most helpful for a media company missioned with ending the Chinese Communist Party, a pandemic originating from China provided endless opportunities for takes that aligned with hawkish conservatives and conspiracy theorists.\n\nThe Epoch Times was early to lay blame on China for Covid \u2014 labeling it the \u201cCCP Virus\u201d in its coverage. (The origin of the outbreak is unknown; the best evidence still points to natural transmission from an animal market.) China\u2019s documented handling of the virus, including withholding information from researchers, a crackdown on whistleblowers and an authoritarian public health response, added credibility to The Epoch Times\u2019 unproven claims.\n\n\u201cThe dynamic for The Epoch Times changed in 2020, partly because of their criticism of China around Covid,\u201d said A.J. Bauer, an assistant journalism professor at the University of Alabama who studies conservative media. \u201cAn entire new kind of ecosystem of Covid deniers and skeptics overlapped with right-wing media and were citing and drawing heavily upon The Epoch Times.\u201d\n\nThe Epoch Times\u2019 subscription page began hosting glowing testimonials from Steve Bannon, Glenn Beck and the far-right Arizona congressman Paul Gosar. The organization became a reliable source for misinformation around Covid, its treatments and the vaccines.\n\nThe Epoch Times was also an early and aggressive promoter of election misinformation, according to the Election Integrity Partnership, a coalition of researchers that documented misinformation and the 2020 vote. The group cited the news organization as a \u201crepeat spreader\u201d of false and misleading voter fraud stories as well as a major promoter of debunked conspiracy theories around Dominion voting machines and the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement, aimed at overturning the election results. Months after the election, The Epoch Times refused to acknowledge the results.\n\nWith the new bedfellows came a new revenue stream. Though Falun Gong practitioners had been a reliable source of small donations in previous years, in 2020 the group started to receive gifts and grants from big money conservative donors.\n\nWhile The Epoch Times is not required to list its donors, it reported $8.4 million in revenue from contributions and grants in 2020 and 2021. Tax documents from that period filed by scores of donors, accessed through ProPublica\u2019s nonprofit explorer, show some of those funds came from conservative donors and foundations.\n\nIn 2021, The Epoch Times received $55,750 from the National Christian Charitable Foundation, which connects anonymous donors with Christian causes, and $31,000 from Donors Trust, a fund for conservative and libertarian donors. Smaller donations came from individuals \u2014 real estate agents, investors and surgeons among them \u2014 and small family foundations, most of which support right-wing causes, including evangelical Christian groups, anti-vaccine groups and far-right media organizations.\n\nMost of the donors contacted by NBC News did not respond to interview requests; two declined.\n\nThe Epoch Times is pouring its revenue back into its own organization and others connected to the Falun Gong religious movement.\n\nIn the first half of this year, The Epoch Times spent 65% more on ads than in the first six months of 2022, with about half of its budget going to the X platform, formerly Twitter, according to the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Other recent ad buys were made on the right-wing sites Drudge Report, Breitbart and Rumble.\n\nThe Epoch Times paid a company called Data Managing Corporation $2.7 million for advertising services in 2021, according to tax documents. The company\u2019s listed address is a single-family home in New Jersey owned by a reporter for The Epoch Times, who did not return requests for comment.\n\nIn addition to running its business, The Epoch Times provided about $30 million in grants to its own affiliates and connected organizations in 2021, including $10.4 million to the dance troupe Shen Yun, and $8.3 million to New Tang Dynasty, which produces videos.\n\nThe three groups, united under the Falun Gong religious movement, made up a nearly quarter-billion dollar industry in 2021, according to tax documents. Li holds that the Falun Gong messages, shared in articles, videos and dance performances, will result in the salvation of humankind as the end of the world nears."

On March 31, 2023, Kentucky became the 34th state to legalize sports betting and the 25th with online/mobile access. Retail locations opened on September 7 and Kentucky online sports betting became legal on September 28.\n\nThe betting menu for Kentuckians is exhaustive in that they are able to legally wager on all major professional, collegiate and international sports, unlike other sports betting states. With excitement building among customers in the state for Kentucky sports gambling, it's feasible that Kentucky generates over $1 billion in Kentucky sports betting handle by the end of 2023.\n\nKentucky Sportsbook Apps to Know\n\nSportsbook Platforms App Features* Fanatics iOS and Android apps FanCash Rewards, bettable search, Discover page, cash outs, easy sign up, secure deposit, Withdrawal Tracker FanDuel iOS and Android apps, desktop and mobile web Quick bets, secure deposits, horse racing, casino, cash outs, fast payouts DraftKings iOS and Android apps, desktop and mobile web\n\nCasino, fast withdrawals, secure deposits BetMGM iOS and Android apps, desktop and mobile web\n\nEasy deposits and withdrawals, 24/7 access, safe and secure transactions Caesars iOS and Android apps, desktop and mobile web\n\nCaesars Rewards, casino, Quick Picks Bet365 iOS and Android apps, desktop and mobile web\n\nCash outs, personalized display, alerts, edit bets, My Teams, search, sports stats\n\nSports Betting on Kentucky (and Nearby) Teams\n\nKentucky Wildcats: One of the most iconic college basketball programs in the nation, the Kentucky Wildcats should be an extremely popular betting option for Bluegrass State residents. The eight-time national champions have been led by legendary coach John Calipari since 2010 and they have appeared in four Final Fours during his tenure, recording a national title in 2012. The program's 2,021-637 all-time record is the best in college basketball history. Though best known for its basketball prowess, Kentucky has also found more success on the gridiron in recent years in the SEC, including a dozen bowl appearances since 2006.\n\nLouisville Cardinals: The Wildcats have the historic edge, but Louisville basketball won the more recent national title, cutting down the nets in 2013. They've been to 10 Final Fours and own the 12th-best record (1,726-874) in college basketball history. Louisville has also become a bigger name in the college football world in the past couple decades. Well known for 2013 Heisman winner Lamar Jackson, Louisville transitioned to the ACC in 2014 and the Cardinals have finished in the AP Top 25 seven times since 2004.\n\nWestern Kentucky Hilltoppers: Though they don't have the widespread following of UK or Louisville, the Hilltoppers have a nice fanbase in the southern portion of the state and they have the overall athletic success to demand attention in the betting market. A longtime Division I-AA (now known as FCS) power, WKU fully transitioned to the FBS level in 2009 and they've had nine winning seasons since that point. In men's basketball, WKU has made the NCAA Tournament 23 times and its 1,622-720 all-time mark ranks 14th in history, just a couple spots behind Louisville.\n\nCincinnati Bengals: With no \"Big Four\" professional sports teams playing within state lines, many Kentucky residents look just north of the state's border to cheer on the neighboring Cincinnati Bengals. A franchise long known for its futility in the early days of existence became more of a contender under Marvin Lewis with seven playoff appearances between 2005-15. The franchise got another jolt more recently with stars such as Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase leading Cincinnati to a Super Bowl appearance in 2021 and an AFC title game appearance in 2022. The Indianapolis Colts and Tennessee Titans are also NFL franchises located within short drives of portions of Kentucky.\n\nCincinnati Reds: The state's MLB allegiances are a bit more split with the St. Louis Cardinals also drawing a big following, particularly in the western portion of the state, but the Reds are largely considered the most popular team for Kentucky residents. The Reds won modern-era titles in 1975, 1976 and 1990, but haven't advanced past the NLCS since that point. They've largely struggled in recent years, but the 2023 team has pushed for a playoff spot all season, just in time to draw the attention of new Kentucky sports bettors.\n\nTop Kentucky betting terms for new bettors\n\nAgainst the spread: Instead of betting on an exact winner, the widely-popular spread bet levels the playing field by allowing you to wager on how many points a team will win by. In basketball, if Kentucky is the 7.5-point favorite against Louisville then Kentucky can cover the spread if it wins by 8 or more points. However, Louisville as the 7.5-point underdog can cover the spread by winning outright or losing by 7 or fewer points.\n\nMoney line: Think of this as an elevated outright bet, with odds adjusted to reflect a favored team and an underdog. If Kentucky is listed as a -200 favorite against Florida, you'd need to bet $200 to return $100 on Kentucky to win. That means that Florida as the +200 underdog would return $200 on a $100 bet if that team wins.\n\nOutright bet: This is the easiest wager that can be placed, and it's perfect for betting on one of Kentucky's biggest sporting events: Horse racing. With an outright bet, bettors choose one athlete -- or thoroughbred -- to win an entire sporting event.\n\nOver/Under: If team sports is more your thing, placing an Over/Under bet is the way to go. Kentucky sportsbooks will post an estimated total of both team's final scores in a game, and you wager on whether the actual final will be higher or lower than the estimate. So if the If the Over/Under for a Kentucky vs. Louisville basketball game is 125.5, you would wager on the final total being Over 126 or Under 125.\n\nPlayer prop: Kentucky is one of the 18 states that allows you to place prop bets on collegiate athletes. Sportsbooks will project what a player's stat will be at the end of a game, and you will wager whether the player will end that game over or under that projection. Popular player props include how many touchdown passes a quarterback will throw or how many three-point shots a basketball player will hit.\n\nUnderdog: The underdog is the team deemed less likely to win the game based on the odds. A bet on an underdog typically yields a larger return than a bet on the favorite.\n\nFavorite: On the other hand, a favorite is the team that is deemed more likely to win the game. Bettors often pay a premium for betting on a favorite but they're also the team that more often wins the game outright.\n\nConsensus odds: These odds are generally defined as an average of all available betting markets. Different sportsbooks may price markets variably based on the action they've taken or their own interpretation of information.\n\nFutures: While money line, against the spread and over/under bets are all single-game bets, futures markets encompass almost anything that falls outside of that spectrum. Futures bets include total regular-season wins, championship odds, MVP odds and more.\n\nParlay: This popular betting style is a little more complex. A parlay requires you to include two or more bets within a single wager, and all of your bets must win for the parlay to be a winner. For example, if you wager $100 on a three-leg parlay at 6 to 1 odds, you could win $600 if all three legs of the bet are winners.\n\nJuice: Also known as \"The Vig\" or vigorish, juice is effectively the tax that oddsmakers charge for handling a wager. If a book determines a game is a virtual coinflip, they may price both options at -110 to give themselves a 10% rake on all the action.\n\nPush: A push is a bet where neither the bettor or the sportsbook wins. If an over/under for total points in a football game is set at 44 and both teams combine to score exactly 44 points, the result is a push and the principle is returned to the bettor.\n\nLive/in-game betting: Many sportsbooks now offer live/in-game wagering that allows you to make bets on several different markets in real-time. In basketball, you can bet on the outcome of a quarter, individual statistics and live-updated spreads/totals.\n\nYou can bet on sports in states like Ohio, New York, and Arizona."

The best NBA betting apps make it simple and convenient.\n\nBelow, you can check the latest NBA Rookie of the Year odds as posted at online sportsbooks and how to bet on them.\n\nCurrent NBA ROTY odds\n\nCheck the current NBA ROTY odds below. Click on any odds to claim your bonus and get started.\n\nWho are the NBA RoY odds favorites?\n\nVictor Wembanyama: Coach Gregg Popovich's Spurs have a gem in Victor Wembanyama, a generational talent and a strong Rookie of the Year contender. Even with a young roster and potential load management, Wembanyama's undeniable impact is evident.\n\nHis elite defense, highlighted by his 7-foot-4 height and 8-foot wingspan, allows him to dominate where others can't. Offensively, his agility and skill set are unparalleled for his size. If he refines his shooting and continues to adapt to the Spurs' style, as seen in his impressive NBA preseason performance, he'll be a force to reckon with.\n\nScoot Henderson: The Portland Trail Blazers have restructured, placing Henderson as Damian Lillard's successor. Supported by talents such as Anfernee Simons and Jerami Grant, much of the Blazers' fortunes hinge on Henderson.\n\nAfter a stellar season with the G League Ignite, expectations for his rookie year are soaring. Known for his strength and agility, and with a promising defense, Henderson is set to become a fan favorite.\n\nChet Holmgren: The Oklahoma City Thunder anticipate a strong season, largely due to Holmgren. Boasting a 7-foot frame and notable skills, Holmgren stands out as a Rookie of the Year contender, underpinned by impressive stats and team impact.\n\nHis wingspan and defensive prowess will challenge opponents. Offensively, he capitalizes on mismatches and has diverse scoring abilities, from the paint to the 3-point line. His underrated passing syncs well with OKC's pace and style.\n\nHow to bet on NBA Rookie of the Year\n\nThe first thing you need when preparing to bet on the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, or any other bet, is an account at an online sportsbook.\n\nSigning up for a new betting account doesn\u2019t take much time. Once you visit the online sportsbook you\u2019re interested in, click a \u201csign up\u201d or \u201cregister\u201d button. This will take you to a form for your details. Fill that out and accept the sportsbook\u2019s terms and conditions.\n\nAt that point, you\u2019ll be able to claim your welcome bonus, which you\u2019ll qualify for by following the link on this page from our site to the online sportsbook. If you need to enter a code to get the bonus, you\u2019ll also find that code on our site.\n\nWe urge you to read the requirements for any available promotions and offers before accepting them so you\u2019re aware of any restrictions before betting.\n\nYou can now place your initial deposit, which is easy at online betting sites thanks to various deposit and withdrawal options.\n\nTo bet on the NBA Rookie of the Year, navigate to the basketball section of the sportsbook website, select the NBA, and go to the futures tab.\n\nYou\u2019ll find Rookie of the Year odds, NBA MVP odds, and more there. Select the bet you want to make, enter the amount you want to bet, and finalize your bet slip.\n\nEnsure you\u2019re using only legal online sportsbooks for any type of betting. Offshore sportsbooks advertise widely on the internet, but they are illegal and offer no protection against fraud and other criminal activities.\n\nBest sportsbooks for NBA Rookie of the Year odds\n\nHere are some of the best sports betting sites where you can bet on the next NBA Rookie of the Year.\n\nDraftKings Sportsbook: DraftKings, known as a daily fantasy sports operator before becoming a renowned sportsbook, offers up a nice variety of futures bets, including the NBA Rookie of the Year award.

It offers favorable odds for almost every bet type, including NBA ROTY betting, and offers a nice variety of deposit and withdrawal options. Additionally, Caesars has a competitive welcome bonus for new players and runs NBA betting promos for existing players.\n\nWhen is the best time for NBA ROTY odds?\n\nThe earlier you bet on NBA ROTY, the better the odds. But you\u2019ll be doing so without much information that could be key in making an educated decision.\n\nConversely, if you wait for the data you need for an informed bet, the odds will tighten up, and you will see less of a return on your wager.\n\nWhen the lines are first released for NBA ROTY honors, the season hasn\u2019t even started yet, so there are no statistics, trends, or player news. The pre-season odds are so favorable because even the oddsmakers don\u2019t have the data to craft more specific lines.\n\nOnce the season has started and you get to see how the various rookies are performing, you can gather the relevant data. But sportsbooks are also gathering this information, and they begin to tighten the NBA Rookie of the Year lines in response.\n\nSo, while you can better guess which player will hoist the Wilt Chamberlain Trophy, the odds will be tighter, and your potential return on your wager will be reduced.\n\nPros and cons of betting early on the NBA Rookie of the Year:\n\nPros:\n\nYou have an opportunity to find better value.\n\nThe betting odds are fresh and haven't been adjusted.\n\nCons:\n\nThere is a much higher risk as a player's performance, health, and team dynamic can change throughout the season.\n\nYou\u2019ll find limited information to make an informed bet.\n\nPros and cons of waiting to bet on the NBA Rookie of the Year:\n\nPros:\n\nThere is a lot more information available to make an informed bet.\n\nYou don\u2019t risk betting on a player not remotely in contention.\n\nCons:\n\nThere is a reduced opportunity to find value.\n\nThe odds may not be as favorable.\n\nKeep in mind that it\u2019s always important to take into consideration your risk tolerance while you weigh the potential rewards. No matter when you decide to make your wager, always gather as much information as possible before risking your hard-earned money.\n\nWho are the past NBA ROTY winners?\n\nFor context, here is a list of the National Basketball Association Rookie of the Year winners since 2010.\n\nSeason Player Position Team 2023 Paolo Banchero Forward Orlando Magic 2022 Scottie Barnes Forward Toronto Raptors 2021 LaMelo Ball Guard Charlotte Hornets 2020 Ja Morant Guard Memphis Grizzlies 2019 Luka Don\u010di\u0107 Guard/Forward Dallas Mavericks 2018 Ben Simmons Forward/Guard Philadelphia 76ers 2017 Malcolm Brogdon Guard Milwaukee Bucks 2016 Karl-Anthony Towns Center Minnesota Timberwolves 2015 Andrew Wiggins Forward/Guard Minnesota Timberwolves 2014 Michael Carter-Williams Guard Philadelphia 76ers 2013 Damian Lillard Guard Portland Trail Blazers 2012 Kyrie Irving Guard Cleveland Cavaliers 2011 Blake Griffin Forward Los Angeles Clippers 2010 Tyreke Evans Guard/Forward Sacramento Kings\n\nWhat other NBA futures can I bet on?\n\nRookie of the Year is not the only form of NBA futures betting. Legal online sportsbooks have a wide selection of NBA futures you can bet on, including:\n\nIn addition to futures bets, you can wager on many NBA bets during the regular season and postseason. NBA game lines (moneylines, point spreads, and totals) are the most popular, but you\u2019ll also be able to bet on NBA team and player props, parlays, and more.\n\nThe NBA is the second-most popular odds market to bet on in the US, behind NFL betting odds. That means every online betting site always has a great selection of NBA odds."

        "body": "Who is Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of crypto exchange FTX? Is he a liar and a fraud? Or did he act in good faith, and like many a startup founder, fly too close to the sun?\n\nThat answer ultimately lies with the jury, which was selected on Wednesday morning before lawyers for the government and then Bankman-Fried swapped two very different stories of the former crypto mogul\u2019s sudden rise and almost instantaneous fall.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened on the second day of the trial, which featured pointed allegations, a friend from MIT, and an audience replete with big names, including Bankman-Fried\u2019s professorial parents and Damian Williams, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n\nA conscious criminal\u2026\n\nThe prosecution\u2019s account of the alleged crimes by Bankman-Fried, who spent most of his day in court staring into a laptop while seated between his two attorneys, featured a study in contrasts.\n\n\u201cOne year ago, it looked like the defendant was on the top of the world,\u201d began Thane Rehn, a prosecutor for the government, in his opening statement. The former CEO of FTX oversaw a supposedly thriving crypto exchange, jetted between international locales, and hobnobbed with celebrities like Tom Brady and Larry David. He repeatedly emphasized to customers that their money was safe and secure.\n\nBut \u201call of that, all of it, was built on lies,\u201d Rehn declared to the jury. \u201cBehind the curtains, he was not what he appeared to be.\u201d What followed was a roughly 30-minute story that repeatedly emphasized how Bankman-Fried allegedly stole customer funds to facilitate his jet-setting lifestyle, donate millions to political candidates, and finance risky bets.\n\nThe key to his alleged scheme? Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund he also owned, argued Rehn. Using Caroline Ellison, his on-again off-again girlfriend and the CEO of Alameda, as a front, Bankman-Fried had \u201csecret access\u201d to customer money\u2014both cash and crypto\u2014the government claimed.\n\nMoreover, Bankman-Fried allegedly directed employees to conceal the flow of money into FTX\u2019s coffers and forged financial documents distributed to lenders and investors. \u201cThe defendant lied to the world,\u201d Rehn alleged.\n\nAnd who was this defendant? Not a crypto \u201cboy\u201d genius, as so many in the media (Fortune included) have written, but a \u201cman\u201d who \u201cstole billions of dollars from thousands of victims,\u201d Rehn said. \u201cYou will see the full picture.\u201d\n\n\u2026or a well-meaning founder?\n\nBut Bankman-Fried, whose cheekbones were more prominent after spending about seven weeks in a Brooklyn prison, was no liar, according to Mark Cohen, one of his lawyers. \u201cSam didn\u2019t defraud anyone,\u201d he said early on in his opening statement.\n\nWhat the jury will see is a nerdy startup founder who acted in \u201cgood faith,\u201d not the prosecution\u2019s \u201ccartoon of a villain.\u201d (Cohen repeatedly harped on Bankman-Fried\u2019s allegedly good-faith actions throughout his address to the jury.)\n\nAlameda was not subterranean or shady. It was a successful hedge fund, he said. FTX was no Ponzi scheme. It was a \u201cvery innovative, successful company.\u201d And the business practices between the two were reasonable, he argued, claiming that Alameda acted legally as an FTX customer, payment processor, and market maker, or financial entity that acts as a trading partner for customers looking to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn an analogy he employed throughout his opening statement, he said that \u201cworking at a startup is like building a plane as you\u2019re flying it\u201d and that businesses sometimes fail. In fact, he specifically pointed the finger at Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda, who, he said, did not adequately protect her hedge fund from the inherent risk of the crypto markets.\n\nWhen the walls came closing in and the aforementioned plane approached the \u201ceye of the storm,\u201d Bankman-Fried did not act like someone who was guilty. Rather, he was willing to give up his personal wealth to make customers whole, Cohen argued.\n\n\u201cIn the end, Sam started and built two billion-dollar businesses,\u201d he concluded. \u201cHe didn\u2019t steal any money.\u201d\n\nA Frenchman who lives in London testifies in New York\n\nAfter lawyers from both sides depicted two very different Bankman-Frieds, the prosecution called its first two witnesses to the stand\u2014and they weren\u2019t blockbuster names or former lieutenants-turned-government-cooperators, like Ellison.\n\nThe first was a victim: Marc-Antoine Julliard, a Paris-born cocoa trader who lives in London. In 2021, Julliard, who had coiffed hair and spoke with a strong French accent, decided to invest in crypto and landed on FTX as his exchange of choice, where he traded cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin.\n\nOn Nov. 8, in the crypto exchange\u2019s final few days, he tried to pull out his cash and crypto. How much? Almost $100,000, he said. And was he ever able to? \u201cNever,\u201d he told prosecutors.\n\nShortly afterward, as the trial neared late afternoon, the government called Adam Yedidia to the stand. A fast-talking graduate of MIT, he and Bankman-Fried were close friends in college, he said. And after Bankman-Fried left Jane Street, the high-frequency trading firm where the former billionaire got his start in finance after MIT, he persuaded Yedidia to join him as a trader at Alameda and then as a developer at FTX.\n\nWhen Yedidia first took the stand, Danielle Sassoon, one of the lead prosecutors, said that the college friend of Bankman-Fried had legal immunity during his testimony. Why did he make such a deal with the government, she asked.\n\n\u201cI was concerned that I had unwittingly written code that contributed to a crime,\u201d he said.\n\nSoon, however, the clock neared 4:30 p.m., and court adjourned for the day. Yedidia will continue his testimony on Thursday, followed by Matt Huang, a former partner at the high-powered venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, and then Gary Wang, a key Bankman-Fried lieutenant and one of the government\u2019s star witnesses."

It\u2019s TC\u2019s column that highlights the major stories over the past few days, and \u2014 we humbly submit \u2014 it\u2019s a darn useful resource for folks on the go.\n\nThis week, we cover Sam Altman backing a teen\u2019s AI startup, Google\u2019s hardware event (and first impressions of the Pixel 8 Pro), Flexport drama, and the ongoing FTX fallout. Also on the agenda: Gmail\u2019s harsher rules to prevent spam, TikTok testing an ad-free subscription plan, and LinkedIn going big on AI tools. And that\u2019s not all.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t, sign up here to get WiR in your inbox every Saturday. And if you have, our thanks. Now, let\u2019s get on with the news.\n\nMost read\n\nAltman backs teen entrepreneurs: Sam Altman is among the backers of an AI startup, founded by two teenagers, that\u2019s aiming to assist businesses in automating workflows in \u201cpreviously unexplored\u201d ways. Manish writes that Induced AI, founded this year, lets businesses input their back-office tasks in plain English and converts the instructions to pseudo-code in real time.\n\nGoogle unveils new hardware: This week was Google\u2019s annual hardware event, where the search and consumer tech giant showed off what it\u2019s been working on. Christine wrote up a thorough roundup of the news, which included updates on the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, Android 14, Pixel Buds, Google Assistant, Bard, Pixel Watch 2 and other goodies.\n\nHands on with the Pixel 8 Pro: Darrell took the newly unveiled Pixel 8 Pro for a whirl, and he liked what he saw. While very similar to last year\u2019s model (the Pixel 7 Pro), Darrell felt that the improved cameras, brighter screen and enhanced AI-powered features made it enough of an upgrade to (potentially) warrant a purchase \u2014 minus the underutilized temperature sensor. Stay tuned for his full review.\n\nTurmoil at Flexport: Dave Clark, the former Amazon executive who was ousted as CEO of Flexport just a year into the job, fired back at its founder and board, calling recent reporting on the logistics company \u201cdeeply concerning.\u201d Clark made the comments Monday in a lengthy post on social media site X following a report from CNBC that provided new information about his last days at Flexport, a freight forwarding and customs brokerage startup valued at $8 billion.\n\nSBF allegedly tried to buy off Trump: The TC team\u2019s been trained on the Manhattan Federal Court for the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced entrepreneur accused of orchestrating the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. But fascinating details about SBF\u2019s political dealings are emerging from a book by Michael Lewis, \u201cGoing Infinite,\u201d that debuted on the first day of the trial, like SBF\u2019s attempt to buy off Trump to get him to not run again for president.\n\nGmail fights back against spammers: Google this week announced a series of significant changes to how it handles email from bulk senders in an effort to cut down on spam and other unwanted emails. The company says that, starting next year, bulk senders will need to authenticate their emails, offer an easy way to unsubscribe and stay under a reported spam threshold.\n\nTikTok tests an ad-free tier: TikTok is testing an ad-free subscription tier for some users. For $4.99, subscribers get an ad-free experience on TikTok \u2014 no other strings attached. But don\u2019t look for the option to arrive anytime soon. TikTok says that it\u2019s piloting the plan in a single, English-speaking market outside the U.S. for now.\n\nLinkedIn leans into AI tools: LinkedIn this week unveiled a string of new AI features spanning its job hunting, marketing and sales products, Ingrid writes. They include a big update to its Recruiter talent sourcing platform, with AI assistance built into it throughout; an AI-powered LinkedIn Learning coach; and a new AI-powered tool for marketing campaigns.\n\nMusk comes clean about X\u2019s metrics \u2014 maybe: In September, Elon Musk said that X users were generating a lot of content \u2014 creating 100 million to 200 million posts every day, excluding retweets. But speaking at an event this week, X CEO Linda Yaccarino offered a contradictory figure. She claimed X was seeing 500 million posts per day on the platform. So who\u2019s right? Beats us.\n\nFormer NSA director\u2019s startup shutters: IronNet, a once-promising cybersecurity startup founded by a former NSA director, has shuttered and laid off its remaining staff following its collapse. The Virginia-based IronNet was founded in 2014 by retired four-star general Keith Alexander and had raised more than $400 million in funding. But IronNet failed to gain traction after going public in August 2021, and its stock price continued to steeply decline in the wake of an initial spike.\n\nAudio\n\nOn the hunt for a new podcast to listen to while you work out, do the dishes or rake the leaves (now that fall\u2019s arrived)? Look no further than TechCrunch\u2019s roster, which covers the world of startups, the blockchain and more.\n\nOn Equity this week, the crew talked about the SBF trial; deals from VR firms Rainforest, At One Ventures, Section 32 and Greylock, where venture funding has declined; and how Fearless Fund, a firm founded to invest in women of color, is being barred from awarding grants to Black women founders.\n\nMeanwhile, Found featured Esther Rodriguez-Villegas from Acurable, a medical device company that makes patient-friendly wearable devices to diagnose and manage respiratory conditions at home. As a career-long academic, Rodriguez-Villegas talks about how she never intended to be a founder until she learned about how the currently available medical devices make it extremely difficult to detect and treat diseases like sleep apnea and epilepsy.\n\nAnd over on Chain Reaction, Jacquelyn did a crossover episode with Alex about the SBF trial. Jacquelyn has been on the ground at the Southern District of New York courthouse, listening in to the trial in the same room as Bankman-Fried, so there was lots to talk about.\n\nTechCrunch+\n\nTC+ subscribers get access to in-depth commentary, analysis and surveys \u2014 which you know if you\u2019re already a subscriber. If you\u2019re not, consider signing up. Here are a few highlights from this week:\n\nInside the SBF trial: Rebecca and Jacquelyn report on the second day of the SBF and FTX trial. The prosecution painted Bankman-Fried as someone who knowingly committed fraud to achieve great wealth, power and influence, while the defense countered that the FTX founder acted in good faith, never meant to commit fraud or steal and basically got in over his head.\n\nBattery-boosting software tech: Tim covers Breathe Battery Technologies, a startup that\u2019s developed a bit of software that can be slipped into just about any lithium-ion battery in use today \u2014 endowing it with either faster charging speeds or greater longevity.\n\nWhat lies beyond ChatGPT: Anna surveyed 10 investors about the future of AI and what they believe might be the next big thing. Among other topics, they touched on where startups still stand a chance, where oligopoly dynamics and first-mover advantages are shaping up and the value of proprietary data."

        "body": "Twitch has had a tense year, in part due to community backlash over policy changes that affect the way creators can monetize their content.\n\nLast year, the company announced that it would end the 70/30 subscription revenue split deal that it had offered select streamers in favor of prioritizing ad revenue. In June, Twitch launched the Partner Plus program, a new monetization tier that would grant eligible creators a 70/30 subscription revenue split on the first $100,000 they make per year. The program further strained its relationship with its community, because the requirements to qualify excluded the vast majority of streamers. Streamers need at least 350 monthly paid subscriptions, and gift subs and monthly subs that come with an Amazon Prime account don\u2019t count.\n\nIn response, Twitch pivoted eligibility to a points-based system, assigning a value to each subscription tier. The higher-priced subscriptions now count more toward the point total.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 We\u2019re updating how we calculate progress toward the Partner Plus program. To recognize deeper support from your community, Tier 1, 2, and 3 subs will earn you 1, 2, and 6 points respectively towards qualifying for the program. pic.twitter.com/HdOiLvg3qC \u2014 Twitch Support (@TwitchSupport) August 28, 2023\n\nTwitch also walked back its policy restricting embedded ads and other sponsored content, following fallout from streamers who depend on branded content as the bulk of their income.\n\nThe company\u2019s CEO Dan Clancy, who took over earlier this year, has prioritized engaging with Twitch streamers, and involving their perspectives in policy changes going forward. The company\u2019s receptiveness to community feedback has marginally lessened animosity from its streamers, and community sentiment toward Twitch at this year\u2019s TwitchCon in Las Vegas was significantly more positive than it was last year. New features and policy changes announced during the convention\u2019s keynote address, including granting streamers more control over ad breaks and allowing simulcasting to other livestreaming platforms, also appeased the Twitch community.\n\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Twitch\u2019s Chief Monetization Officer Mike Minton discussed the unpopular policy decisions, supporting smaller creators through branded partnerships and what Twitch is doing to mend its relationship with its community.\n\nTechCrunch: I\u2019m going to start with a maybe unpleasant question, but Twitch has made some unpopular decisions in terms of monetization. Is there anything that Twitch is doing to appease irate creators?\n\nMike Minton: Two years ago, we said we\u2019re no longer gonna do these deals that weren\u2019t objective in terms of eligibility criteria. We ended that program. It affected a relatively small number of creators, but what it really impacted was the community going, \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to work for.\u201d And that led to us recently announcing Partner Plus. There was some feedback saying, \u201cHey, we\u2019re going to need a lot of subs,\u201d and we reacted to it by making it eligible by sub points so that your higher price point subscriptions cost more, and that was actually received quite positively.\n\nBoth Dan and I have said in different forms, that this is the beginning. It\u2019s not the end and we\u2019re going to continue to work to provide access to higher rev shares as we can over time, to more streamers.\n\nWhat would that look like?\n\nThe simple answer is now, 350 was the criteria we established, right? And that number is arbitrary and could easily come down. Now, our target and our goal in this program still remains the same. We\u2019re looking to benefit the creators, where livestreaming is a meaningful part of what they\u2019re doing as a creator. That allows us to focus on those streamers that are really at a point where it will matter most for them in terms of keeping them as a livestreaming creator.\n\nRight, and that decision to change the revenue split also came out of a decision to prioritize ad revenue. Creators and viewers have said that integrating ads in their streams is very frustrating. What kind of feedback is Twitch going to provide in response to that?\n\nLet\u2019s level set a couple things. So one of the things we knew with ads, if we\u2019re going to get streamers to buy into ads as a good way to monetize, is that we had to increase the rev share, which we did, and launch the ad incentive program.\n\nWe\u2019re helping streamers understand that with ad running, you have to think about it consistently over time in order to earn predictable revenue. It\u2019s a very reliable source of income for many streamers.\n\nSo I think the combination of making it easier to run, increasing the rev share and then recently in the keynote, we talked about two new features to allow moderators to know when an ad break is coming, and adjust the ad break around the content because the problem in livestreaming, as you\u2019re aware, is that people don\u2019t want to miss out. So we\u2019re very focused on improving the ad experience by allowing the ad breaks to be synchronized with the content and enrolling moderations and eventually the community in adjusting those ad breaks.\n\nLike you said, livestreaming is very different from static content, and tactics for monetization that work for Instagram or TikTok just don\u2019t really work for Twitch or any livestreaming platform. In those cases, what has Twitch done differently from those more standard platforms in terms of making monetization more seamless?\n\nOne thing we\u2019ve done since the beginning, where we are a leader, is getting people to take their wallets out and support creators through subscriptions, gifting, cheering. I think that sets us as a unique community-based platform where viewers are directly supporting creators in that way.\n\nOther services have tried it but from what I can tell them, what streamers have told me, is that Twitch is really the leader in that way. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time on advertising, because there\u2019s no social media, content distribution service in the world that doesn\u2019t rely on advertising as a component. So ads have been a big focus.\n\nAnd the third piece, which is where we\u2019re behind, is sponsorships. We\u2019re now focused a lot on growing sponsorship opportunities for streamers and ensuring that we have three \u2014 based on what size you are, where you\u2019re located, how experienced you are, what type of content you\u2019re creating, where you\u2019re located in the world \u2014 three options to support you as a creator.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken to a lot of creators over the course of my career, and a common gripe seems to be that they can\u2019t subsist off of just subs and ad revenue. They have to have these branded partnerships that are difficult to land for midsize creators and smaller creators. What is Twitch doing specifically to diversify its branded partnership content?\n\nWe have this unique opportunity, being part of the third largest and fastest growing advertising business in the world, AKA Amazon. So what we\u2019re actively working on is, as advertisers that come in through Amazon advertising, that they understand the magic of Twitch, that they can easily set up influencer deals programmatically. And ultimately, you don\u2019t have the measurement that they expect.\n\nBut because of Amazon\u2019s diversity of advertisers, this is where before it was more focused on endemic advertisers, game publishers, et cetera. And now we\u2019re able to expand that reach to a much broader set of advertisers and serve the needs of both the affiliate marketing end of sponsorships, which is more of a performance model, as well as more of the top of the funnel, where you\u2019re looking for more brand awareness.\n\nObviously a lot of this discord among Twitch\u2019s community also comes at a time when other streaming platforms like YouTube or Kick are starting to take off, and enticing streamers with better revenue splits. A common complaint that I\u2019ve heard is that bigger streamers are going to be making money wherever they are, but smaller streamers who have less of an audience don\u2019t qualify for Partner Plus will get a better deal at YouTube or Kick than at Twitch. What is Twitch doing to keep those streamers?\n\nThere are a couple of things that I\u2019ll point out. One is acknowledging what Dan has done as the CEO to get out and engage with streamers, hear their concerns, and really influence our priorities as a company, is really a consequence of him both being an active streamer as well as being extremely engaged within the community.\n\nAnd then, more broadly for both Jeremy [Jeremy Forrester is VP of Community Product] and myself as the product leaders, building the product is continuing to innovate and ensure that we are absolutely a unique service. Whether that\u2019s features, like we\u2019re working on Stories, whether that\u2019s monetization \u2014 it\u2019s all in service of ensuring that livestreaming creators can be more successful on Twitch.\n\nFor a long time, there was a sort of exclusivity with Twitch, where there were exclusive deals, and simultaneous streaming on other platforms was forbidden. I have to wonder if those decisions to change these policies were in response to competition from other platforms.\n\nI would say it this way: I think they are an acknowledgement, and maybe a closer connectivity to the community via Dan specifically. I credit Dan in his short time as CEO to really make some big, hard decisions. Both the launch of Partner Plus, as well as simulcasting, the embed stuff we talked about in the keynote \u2014 these are three things that I think are very much an acknowledgement of the feedback from the community. We\u2019ve made that change, so I wouldn\u2019t call it out of competitive pressures. I would call it out of focus on the community."

        "body": "Beeper Mini, the app bringing blue bubble iMessage texts to Android users, is back in operation on Monday after a long weekend that saw Apple putting an end to Beeper\u2019s services, claiming it was a security risk. Now, the startup behind the new app says it has resumed functioning, but hasn\u2019t disclosed how that\u2019s been made possible. In addition, Beeper Mini will be free for the time being given the unstable nature of Beeper\u2019s status and Apple\u2019s attempts at shutting it down.\n\nFounded by former Pebble smartwatch founder Eric Migicovsky, Beeper had originally been working on an app that aggregated all of a user\u2019s chat apps into a single interface. However, upon the discovery of new technology that allowed it to reverse-engineer the iMessage protocol, it set out to build a new app called Beeper Mini that solely focused on bringing iMessage chats to Android users for $1.99 per month. That included support for high-quality photos and videos, tapback reactions, typing indicators, read receipts and more.\n\nThe app quickly climbed into the top 20 in the Play Store\u2019s charts and saw over 100,000 downloads in its first 48 hours, the company claims.\n\nUnfortunately, Beeper Mini\u2019s success was short-lived. Only days after launching, Apple on Friday night took action against the startup, having found a way to stop Beeper Mini\u2019s messages from being passed from Android phones to its servers. The Cupertino tech giant explained that it needed to shut down the app because it \u201cposed significant risks to user security and privacy, including the potential for metadata exposure and enabling unwanted messages, spam, and phishing attacks.\u201d Essentially, Apple said that it couldn\u2019t verify that Beeper\u2019s claims of end-to-end encryption were true, and therefore it needed to take \u201csteps to protect our users by blocking techniques that exploit fake credentials in order to gain access to iMessage.\u201d\n\nAs the Beeper team scrambled for a fix, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) shamed Apple for its intervention in a post on X, formerly Twitter, saying \u201cGreen bubble texts are less secure. So why would Apple block a new app allowing Android users to chat with iPhone users on iMessage? Big Tech executives are protecting profits by squashing competitors. Chatting between different platforms should be easy and secure,\u201d she wrote.\n\nOn Monday, Beeper announced on its blog that it has updated the Beeper Mini app to fix the issue that \u201ccaused messages not to be sent or received.\u201d It hasn\u2019t said exactly how it\u2019s made that happen, but notes that the security of Beeper Mini remains unchanged \u2014 promising it still includes local, end-to-end encryption as previously described. Migicovsky told TechCrunch he can\u2019t share anything on that topic beyond what\u2019s already in the blog post.\n\nThough Beeper Mini is running again, there is a caveat: phone number registration isn\u2019t yet working. That means users will have to sign in with an Apple ID. The startup says it\u2019s working to address this too.\n\nIt has also decided to make Beeper Mini free for the time being, given how \u201cchaotic\u201d things have been over the past few days. \u201cAs soon as things stabilize (we hope they will), we\u2019ll look at turning on subscriptions again,\u201d the blog post reads.\n\nAlthough Beeper did not have its app reviewed by an independent third-party security firm before launch, it\u2019s challenging Apple to put it to the test.\n\n\u201cIf Apple doubts the security and privacy of our app, we\u2019re willing to share the entire Beeper Mini codebase with a mutually agreed upon 3rd party security research firm,\u201d the blog post stated. Asked if they would run an audit without Apple\u2019s participation, Migicovsky tells us he wants Apple to agree on the firm first. The company also said it would be willing to add a pager emoji to metadata on all its sent messages, which would allow the Messages app to filter out messages from Beeper Mini users.\n\nUsers can get the updated version of Beeper Mini from beeper.com/update on their phone for the time being as the company has not yet submitted the new version to the Play Store, claiming it needs to do some final testing. But that means users are being asked to sideload the app update onto their devices, which is riskier than downloading from the Play Store, where apps undergo reviews and basic security checks. The app update is now live on Google Play (updated, 1:28 pm ET).\n\nThe update, which now prompts users to sign in with their Apple ID, also includes new features, like chats that will open at the last unread message and an improved video player, the blog post noted. In tests, signing in with our Apple ID generated an Apple prompt that noted our ID was being used to sign in with a device \u201cnear Los Angeles, CA\u201d (where we are not located.) We received an error message \u201c2FA submission error\u201d after updating the app, but an uninstall/reinstall fixed this. We understand this is a known bug.\n\nAfter setting up the new Beeper Mini, a message appeared on our iPhone that said: \u201cDevice Added to Your Account. A Mac now has access to iMessage,\u201d which offers a hint as to Beeper\u2019s fix.\n\nApple has not yet gotten in touch directly with Beeper, having only released a statement to the press. It\u2019s unclear at this time if, how, or when it will be able to disable Beeper\u2019s updated build."

        "body": "LAUDERDALE-BY-THE-SEA, Fla. \u2014 The Buffalo Bills have a new safety this season.\n\nHe sometimes plays close to the line of scrimmage, even lining up in the gaps and banging helmets with interior linemen. They use him as a hybrid linebacker in a three-safety dime package. He has played free safety, strong safety, outside cornerback, inside cornerback, left linebacker and right linebacker. And more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhysically and mentally, he is being challenged, but he\u2019s grateful, content and all in.\n\nThe Bills\u2019 new safety is Jordan Poyer. It\u2019s the same Jordan Poyer who played for the team the previous six seasons, the only player in the NFL to have 500 or more tackles, 20 or more interceptions and 10 or more sacks in that time frame, a Bills captain for the fourth time, an Ed Block Courage Award winner in 2017, a Pro Bowl safety last year and an All-Pro the year before.\n\nBut this is a new Jordan Poyer because of ayahuasca.\n\nIn the spring of 2020, NFL team facilities were closed because of COVID-19, so Bills defenders met in Washington, D.C., for a few days to train, study and bond.\n\nThe first evening, cornerback Josh Norman welcomed the players to his home, and out came the shots of tequila. When Poyer was handed a shot, he looked at it and then at his teammates.\n\nHe put it down.\n\nNorman and the others, who had never seen him turn down a drink, were taken aback.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d one said. \u201cCome on, Deejay Poyo!\u201d\n\nDeejay Poyo was Poyer\u2019s alter ego. Inspired by tequila and a turntable, Poyer became someone else. And for Poyer, there was value in being someone else.\n\nWhat his teammates didn\u2019t know was that Poyer had not put alcohol to his lips in about three months, since he downed a shot of tequila on March 13 in the Puerto Vallarta airport bar during a 12-hour flight delay.\n\nPoyer spent his childhood in Astoria, Ore., a picturesque town on the mouth of the Columbia River not far from the Pacific Ocean. His mother and stepfather worked at a juvenile detention center and raised him with a strict hand. When he was no longer under their watch, unsupervised as a freshman at Oregon State, Poyer drank. And drank and drank.\n\nIt never seemed to affect his play in college, where he was a consensus All-American. And despite his continued drinking, he made steady progress in his early NFL years.\n\nGO DEEPER Graham: Bills rally around Sean McDermott in another win over Chiefs\n\nIn his third season, when he was an emerging starter with the Cleveland Browns, he DM\u2019d an Instagram model after she liked one of his posts on Twitter. She was a freshman at Florida Atlantic, a small-town girl from the Adirondacks who knew nothing about football but thought Poyer was cute. He traveled to Florida to meet her, and before the weekend was over, Poyer declared, \u201cI\u2019m going to marry this girl.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPoyer made numerous trips to Florida that offseason. That spring as Rachel Bush was finishing her freshman year of college, she learned she was pregnant. After their daughter, Aliyah, was born, Poyer signed with the Bills, and the family moved to Buffalo. He and Rachel married in 2018.\n\nHis drinking was out of control by then. He would down a six-pack of IPAs in 20 to 30 minutes for a quick buzz. Blacking out was a regular occurrence. His behavior tested his marriage, but there was a draw between him and Rachel like a north pole to south.\n\nAfter the Bills lost to the Houston Texans in the wild-card round of the 2019 playoffs, Poyer was crestfallen. He says he drank heavily every day for five weeks. At one point Rachel rid their home of all alcohol, but he would still sneak what he could.\n\nRachel says her husband hid alcohol from her beneath bathroom cabinets and other places \u201clike a child.\u201d\n\nHe was close to losing her.\n\nThe drinking, he realized, was an attempt to relieve stress \u2014 stress from football expectations and stress from family life. He was a worrier, except with a drink in his hand.\n\nPoyer went to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Then another, and another.\n\nThe get-together at Norman\u2019s house was his first significant temptation.\n\n\u201cWhen I put that drink down for the first time, it was almost like I overcame a demon,\u201d Poyer says.\n\nThe more time that passed, the less Poyer wanted to drink. He has no desire for it now, and the smell of alcohol almost makes him gag.\n\nDespite a stellar career and a loving family, Bills safety Jordan Poyer \u201cfelt like there was something missing\u201d as recently as last year. (Dan Pompei / The Athletic)\n\nBeing sober didn\u2019t make him immune to anxiety and depression, however. In the 2022 season, he missed five games with elbow, foot, knee and rib injuries. When the Bills lost to the Bengals in the divisional playoff round, Poyer felt responsible for not doing more.\n\nAnd his angst ran deeper than football.\n\n\u201cI still felt like there was something missing because I have this beautiful house, a beautiful family, everything anyone could ask for,\u201d he says. \u201cI still felt a sense of unhappiness, a sense of not understanding who I was, and why I was the way I was. A part of me felt guilty just because I was living this way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPoyer couldn\u2019t come to terms with why, despite all his shortcomings, he was in such an enviable position. His football journey was improbable. No major college wanted him until Oregon State came in with a late offer to grayshirt, meaning his scholarship wouldn\u2019t begin until January of his freshman year. He was chosen in the seventh round of the 2013 NFL draft, came into the league as a cornerback, was cut six games into his rookie season and then had to learn a new position with a new team. He took a blind-side hit that put him in the hospital for two days with a lacerated kidney and a concussion. His career could have been over then.\n\nYet by now he has outlasted 191 of the 217 players drafted ahead of him. And he hasn\u2019t just survived in the NFL \u2014 he has thrived.\n\nWhat had he done to deserve this?\n\nWas he justifying his good fortune?\n\nWould there be a greater purpose?\n\nIn 2018, Poyer saw a therapist for anxiety once a week. It was unfulfilling.\n\nThe answers were somewhere else.\n\nGO DEEPER NFL Week 14 takeaways: Bills playoff bound? How far can Joe Flacco take the Browns?\n\nIn the Quechua language, ayahuasca (pronounced \u2018eye-ah-WAH-ska\u2019) means \u201cvine of the soul.\u201d\n\nAyahuasca is a psychedelic drug made from the leaves of the Psychotria viridis shrub and the stalks of the Banisteriopsis caapi vine. It has been used for more than a thousand years by Amazonian tribes. Ingesting it can induce a dreamlike feeling, an altered state of consciousness, mystical experiences and euphoria.\n\nIn the summer of 2022, Aaron Rodgers revealed he had taken ayahuasca and credited it with helping him have two of the best seasons of his career for the Packers.\n\nPoyer had never heard of ayahuasca at the time. \u201cMy first thought was eff that,\u201d Poyer says. \u201cYou crazy? I\u2019m not doing that.\u201d\n\nThe funny word kept showing up in different conversations on his social media feeds and podcasts. Poyer researched it and became intrigued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the difficult 2022 season, Rachel suggested Poyer take a \u201cguys trip\u201d after the season to check out. But \u201cguys trips\u201d usually involve alcohol, and he didn\u2019t want that. Sightseeing isn\u2019t his thing. \u201cWhat I really wanted to do was work on trying to be a better me,\u201d he says.\n\nHe discovered Resonance, a retreat center in Costa Rica on a hilltop overlooking the Pacific coast and the cloud forest of Monteverde.\n\nTo prepare his mind to enter a state of awareness, he was to eat only chicken, fish and salad for one month, with no oils and sugar added. Then he had to cut out chicken and fish for the week preceding the ceremony. He also was told to practice yoga and breathing exercises that would be useful if he experienced anxiety during the three ceremonies spread over a week.\n\nIn a tiki hut in a wooded, secluded area, a shaman presented each participant with a cup of ayahuasca brew, which is kind of like tea, but with benefits. Taste is not one of them. Poyer says ayahuasca tastes like earth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s brownish and really thick,\u201d he says. \u201cIt almost looks like oil, but it\u2019s darker and thicker. It\u2019s one of the worst things you could ever taste.\u201d\n\nFor the first hour after swigging it down, he lay in a bean bag chair in silence, setting intentions. Poyer\u2019s intentions were to understand himself better and love better. Eventually, the shaman provided a second cup, and then, enchantment.\n\n\u201cAt first what it felt like was my soul left my body for a good two minutes,\u201d Poyer says.\n\nInitially, it was unsettling.\n\n\u201cPeople try to control it, but you can\u2019t,\u201d Poyer says. \u201cIt took me about five or 10 minutes to figure it out. The ego has to die so the medicine can work. In order to let go and let the medicine do what it\u2019s supposed to do, we have to just breathe.\u201d\n\nFor about the next hour, Poyer says the highest version of himself lectured him out loud. It was, in his word, \u201ccrazy.\u201d First, highest-version Poyer addressed his desire to understand himself better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe was basically saying, \u2018Jordan, look at your life, bro \u2014 what are you mad at?\u2019 \u201d Poyer says. \u201cIt was what I needed to hear because I wasn\u2019t appreciating anything \u2014 not my wife, my daughter, my family, my house. It was all about me and what I wanted.\u201d\n\nThen he turned to loving better. It was, he says, as if a Pandora\u2019s box opened on how to love.\n\nThe remainder of the ceremonies, which lasted nine hours each, were about curiosity, energy and connectedness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about how to be a good human,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it grounds you. Really grounds you.\u201d\n\nJordan Poyer is the Bills\u2019 second-leading tackler but hasn\u2019t made as many big plays as he would like for a defense plagued by injuries. (Sarah Stier / Getty Images)\n\nTwo days before OTAs began last April, Poyer returned to the Bills\u2019 headquarters and stepped on the scale. The needle settled at 179 pounds, about 20 pounds below his playing weight.\n\nAfter resuming his regular routine, the weight came back quickly.\n\nHe discussed his experience with curious teammates, coaches and the team psychologist. Poyer hoped ayahuasca would elevate his football performances as Rodgers believes it did his, but it hasn\u2019t worked that way for him.\n\nHe is the second-leading tackler on his team but hasn\u2019t made as many big plays as he would like. What he has done, according to former Bills defensive coordinator Les Frazier, now an analyst for NFL Network, is enable his defense to be the best it can by lifting others through versatility, sacrifice, toughness and communication. Poyer wears his \u201cC\u201d well.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m playing OK this year,\u201d Poyer said during the Bills\u2019 bye week on the patio of his Florida home. \u201cI\u2019m not playing the best that I\u2019ve played in my career. There are probably two plays I really want back. But I\u2019m doing a lot. And in a very deep sense, I absolutely love that I\u2019m entrusted with doing as much as I\u2019m doing on this defense.\u201d\n\nAyahuasca gifted him in another way \u2014 with perspective.\n\nEgo is a powerful force in professional athletes. It helps them ascend and often hastens their downfalls. In previous seasons, Poyer believes his responses to successes and failures were too ego-driven. Football was him \u2014 he has an NFL logo tattooed on his left shoulder \u2014 and he was football.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot anymore.\n\n\u201cWe still have games left that I\u2019m excited about, but I knew some way, somehow, this universe was going to test me this year,\u201d he says. \u201cWe lost DaQuan Jones, Matt Milano and Tre\u2019Davious White for the season. It\u2019s hard. This s\u2014 is hard. And it\u2019s not just (the losses). I\u2019m 32, not this young spring chicken anymore. You know, s\u2014 hurts all the time. But my perspective is I get to play a game that I love, and I\u2019m healthy enough to play. Every time you come out of a game, that\u2019s a win in its own way.\u201d\n\nGO DEEPER Bills training camp preview: Is 2023 final run for Micah Hyde-Jordan Poyer tandem?\n\nPoyer\u2019s commitment is such that last season, when a rib injury precluded him from airplane travel, he took a 32-hour round-trip drive to play in a game in Kansas City. He wants to lift a Lombardi Trophy badly, as much as ever. But if it doesn\u2019t happen, he believes he can handle the disappointment better.\n\nOn Fridays this season, Poyer, fellow safety Taylor Rapp and assistant strength coach Will Greenberg play crystal bowls at Bills headquarters. \u201cThe different tones that you can tune into can enhance chakras within you and help you heal,\u201d he says.\n\nHealing takes many forms.\n\nWhen Poyer was 12, Louis Dunbar, who has done multiple stints in prison for violent crimes, called him for the first time and stunned him with the revelation he was his biological father. In subsequent conversations, Dunbar often said he wanted to see him or come to one of his games. He never has.\n\n\u201cI always had this hate and resentment toward him I was holding,\u201d says Poyer, who doesn\u2019t know where Dunbar is. \u201cThis experience enabled me to let that go. I realize I wouldn\u2019t have anything \u2014 my daughter and my wife \u2014 if not for him. Even if it was just the seed he gave my mom. So someday I\u2019ll meet him, give him a hug and tell him I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nRachel has no interest in taking ayahuasca. But she is grateful her husband discovered it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter he did ayahuasca, he became like my dream husband,\u201d Rachel says. \u201cI was nervous about what it would do to him, but he came back a totally new man, so appreciative of me and our family.\u201d\n\nBills safety Jordan Poyer with his wife, Rachel, and their daughter, Aliyah. (Courtesy of Rachel Bush Poyer)\n\nHighest-version Poyer made Poyer aware he was not doing the little things \u2014 waking up with a smile, giving Rachel a hug on his way out, or being present even when his attention could be divided.\n\nPoyer has turned off his DMs on Instagram and deleted his Twitter/X account. Instagram features a For You page \u2014 a personalized feed based on user engagement patterns. In the past, Poyer\u2019s was filled with posts of other girls, according to Rachel. Now there\u2019s nothing on Poyer\u2019s For You page except football and ayahuasca. She knows because they have one another\u2019s passwords.\n\n\u201cHis attention now is 100 percent on me, his family and his career,\u201d says Rachel, who has more than 4 million Instagram followers, an OnlyFans page and a line of skincare products.\n\nSome players feel more pressure when the end is closer than the beginning. The Bills have an out in Poyer\u2019s contract after this season. He isn\u2019t stressing about any of it. His focus is here and now.\n\nPoyer has thought about becoming a football commentator after retirement. But he has more to offer than sports talk. He could talk about why he\u2019s never had a vaccine, why Aliyah is homeschooled, or how he believes God transcends religions.\n\nHe could discuss why he has always thought he might be an alien. \u201cI truly feel like I\u2019m not from this planet, always being the odd one out, having different perspectives, thinking differently,\u201d says Poyer, who is fascinated by stars.\n\nPoyer has what philosophers call epistemic humility \u2014 he believes knowledge is limited and filtered by personal experiences. And now he is beginning to solve the mysteries of his existence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy life has been changed forever,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd my purpose is to be a bright light for everybody that I touch and connect with.\u201d\n\nIn March, Poyer will return to Resonance for another retreat. Also planning to go are his cousin who went with him last year, and some first-timers \u2014 his mother, brother, a couple of friends and possibly a couple of teammates. He will be working on a documentary about ayahuasca.\n\nA handpan is a steel musical instrument that generates sound through vibrations. Sound healers and meditators often play the handpan. In Costa Rica, Poyer heard one for the first time and was drawn to it. Now he plays his frequently.\n\nNot long ago, Rachel returned home at about 10 p.m. and was tidying up the kitchen when, in the peace of the night, she heard something coming from the outside balcony upstairs \u2014 ethereal, haunting sounds.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of like something you would hear in a dream,\u201d Rachel says.\n\nIt was music the old Jordan Poyer never could have made.\n\n(Photo: Cooper Neill / Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe Football 100,\u201d the definitive ranking of the NFL\u2019s best 100 players of all time, is on sale now.

        "body": "Week 10 in the NFL had some of the league's best teams not playing. But that didn't stop the excitement, with five teams winning on walk-off field goals and more games coming right down to the wire.\n\nWith that, there were some surprising results and expected domination. Some favorites dug deep to win. Some underdogs turned in shocking upsets.\n\nPutting the latest wins and losses into a blender, here's Sporting News' updated look at how all teams stack up against each other, 1-32 going into Week 11:\n\nNFL WEEK 11 PICKS: Straight up | Against the spread\n\nNFL power rankings Week 11\n\n1. Philadelphia Eagles 8-1 (previous week: 1)\n\nThe Eagles enjoyed a bye trying to get a little healthier for the more difficult stretch run in a top-heavy NFC as they have tough games at the Chiefs (the Super Bowl 57 rematch), vs. the Bills, vs. 49ers and at the Cowboys in the next four. They still look like the conference team to beat as they have proved they still win in many ways around Jalen Hurts.\n\n2. Kansas City Chiefs 7-2 (3)\n\nThe Chiefs had a pretty good week off given they jumped back into the AFC's top seed and home-field advantage spot with the Ravens losing. They already are rolling defensively and expect them to figure out a lot more around Patrick Mahomes after the key Andy Reid bye.\n\n3. Detroit Lions 7-2 (5)\n\nThe Lions are becoming like the Eagles, and that's what makes them the second-best team in the NFC. They can win shootouts with Jared Goff, Amon-Ra St. Brown and their passing game. They also can dominate with the running game. They can win with offense or defense. Dan Campbell is coach of the year.\n\n4. San Francisco 49ers 6-3 (8)\n\nThe 49ers had a surprise offensive get-well game in Jacksonville with Brock Purdy leading the way and all his key supporting weapons doing damage, even without Christian McCaffrey scoring. The biggest development was the defense going back to dominating a good offense.\n\n5. Baltimore Ravens 7-3 (2)\n\nThe Ravens' offense is just fine with the running and passing of Lamar Jackson, but he still can't afford to make big mistakes, which he did vs. the Browns. The defense needs to pick up the pieces, too, stat, ahead of facing the Bengals on a short week.\n\n6. Miami Dolphins 6-3 (6)\n\nThe Dolphins got a much-needed bye to figure out how to beat the better teams in the league. Their defense should be getting a little better to support their often explosive offense. They should feel good about a Week 11 rebound vs. the Raiders.\n\n7. Pittsburgh Steelers 6-3 (9)\n\nThe Steelers are playing the way Mike Tomlin wants, with the running game rolling to big totals with Jaylen Warren and Najee Harris and the defense doing what it needs, more so vs. pass than run, in key moments. You can't argue with the overachieving results.\n\n8. Cleveland Browns 6-3 (10)\n\nThe Browns proved they can win games with defense in another way, with big plays. They also have more offensive pop when Deshaun Watson plays well and the running game doesn't slump. Their playoff hopes look much better after their stunning comeback vs. the Ravens.\n\n9. Jacksonville Jaguars 6-3 (4)\n\nThe Jaguars got an NFC wake-up call against the 49ers, who were much more prepared after a Week 9 bye than they were. Jacksonville needs to forget that debacle and get back on track, stat. The team gets a division double vs. Tennessee and Houston before facing Cincinnati.\n\n10. Dallas Cowboys 6-3 (11)\n\nThe Cowboys took advantage of their \"no contest\" vs. the Giants at home with Dak Prescott continuing to ball as a passer and runner. They need to keep the defense and running game success, too, in bigger games going forward.\n\nMORE: Inside the Cowboys historic offensive explosion vs. Giants\n\n11. Seattle Seahawks 6-3 (13)\n\nThe Seahawks needed every ounce of their offense around Geno Smith to rally to beat the Commanders, but the get-well performance worked well for him, Kenneth Walker and the wide receivers. The defense could be more consistent.\n\n12. Minnesota Vikings 6-4 (14)\n\nThe new man on the Vikings, Josh Dobbs, keeps producing the same results they were enjoying offensively with Kirk Cousins, thanks to more help from the running game for Kevin O'Connell and the defense overall under Brian Flores. Their 0-3 and 1-4 starts are distant memories as the Vikings look for a sixth straight win in Week 11 vs. Denver.\n\n13. Houston Texans 5-4 (16)\n\nThe Texans are looking great with C.J. Stroud leading their offense and now they've found some running game, too. The defense is just making enough plays to put them in position to win high-scoring games. Houston is a legitimate playoff contender under rookie coach DeMeco Ryans.\n\n14. Cincinnati Bengals 5-4 (7)\n\nThe Bengals are battling some key injuries, leaving them much less room for error. Unfortunately, Joe Burrow made key mistakes and the defense wilted against run and pass at home in the loss to the Texans.\n\n15. Buffalo Bills 5-5 (12)\n\nThe Bills fell right into the trap game against the Broncos at home, losing because of more mistakes from Josh Allen. The defense can't tolerate those mistakes with all of its injuries.\n\n16. Las Vegas Raiders 5-5 (22)\n\nThe Raiders are hot, having won two consecutive games for interim coach Antonio Pierce, bringing up flashbacks to the playoff push they made with Rich Bisaccia in 2021. They are right back in the AFC wild-card race with the Dolphins, Chiefs, Vikings ahead.\n\n17. New Orleans Saints 5-5 (15)\n\nThe Saints will go into a bye not knowing what do at quarterback. with Derek Carr further hurting his right shoulder and needed to be checked for a concussion. Jameis Winston did provide a spark, too little too late at Minnesota. But the division lead is precarious with poor QB play overall.\n\n19. Indianapolis Colts 5-5 (19)\n\nThe Colts stopped scoring at least 20 points in every game during their ugly, run-heavy victory in Germany vs. the Patriots. At least Jonathan Taylor is doing his normal things and the defense is playing well again while Gardner Minshew looks meh.\n\n18. Los Angeles Chargers 4-5 (17)\n\nThe Chargers got well offensively with Justin Herbert, Keenan Allen and Austin Ekeler against the Lions. But the defense went back to crumbling vs. big pass plays and added wilting against the run. The pressure is right back on Brandon Staley with a trip to Green Bay next.\n\n20. Tampa Bay Buccaneers 4-5 (23)\n\nBaker Mayfield and the offense is back on track to move the ball well after a brief midseason slump. They're still not lighting it up, but the Bucs are back to playing smart complementary football with their defense rebounding and still might have found a long-term QB answer.\n\n21. New York Jets 4-5 (18)\n\nAaron Rodgers can't come back soon enough, and going for a December miracle might be too late after two straight key losses to the Chargers and Raiders. Zach Wilson will always cap the potential of a talented offense that keeps making mistakes. The Bills and Dolphins in back-to-back division games next might be their season.\n\n22. Denver Broncos 4-5 (24)\n\nThe Broncos got another big win against a AFC power, sandwiching their Week 9 bye with upsets over the Chiefs and Bills. The offense has hit a balanced grooved with Russell Wilson and the defense is making a lot more plays, too.\n\n23. Washington Commanders 4-5 (21)\n\nThe Commanders should be pleased about Sam Howell and the offense showing more fight with additional weapons and the running backs look better all-around again. But the reeling defense and pass protection continue to be un-winnable assets.\n\n24. Atlanta Falcons 4-5 (20)\n\nThe Falcons were forced into another QB change because of injury. They found a few more answers offensively but that position still made it an overall mess. The defense also doesn't seem to be well prepared to different styles of offenses.\n\n25. Green Bay Packers 3-6 (25)\n\nThe Packers saw some improved work from Jordan Love and his young weapons as they spread the ball well in the passing game, but the run defense woes and key holes in coverage have all but doomed their playoff hopes.\n\n26. Los Angeles Rams 3-6 (26)\n\nThe Rams are hoping to find a few more answers during a bye, as Sean McVay has seen his good coaching job earlier in the season go by the wayside with key offensive injuries. They need Matthew Stafford to help save face the rest of the way or the season will look a lot like 2022.\n\n27. Tennessee Titans 3-6 (27)\n\nWill Levis is going through rookie lumps after his dazzling debut as the brutal offensive line woes exacerbated by injuries are getting to him and the entire Titans offense. The Titans still need to keep starting him, because they can't overcome those systemic problems or those in overall pass defense.\n\n28. Chicago Bears 3-7 (29)\n\nThe Bears don't care how they win, but they should be pleased their running game and defense bailed out their limited passing game with Tyson Bagent to secure another win in Week 10. They will hope to finish strong with Justin Fields soon.\n\n29. Arizona Cardinals 2-8 (32)\n\nThe Cardinals got an immediate spark for their offense with Kyler Murray and James Conner back. They also seemed invigorated for Jonathan Gannon on defense and special teams. Look for the Cardinals to finish strong and play a whole lot of spoiler.\n\n30. New England Patriots 2-8 (28)\n\nThe Patriots tried to win a game by hiding Mac Jones and their quarterbacks in general. They almost pulled it off with the running game dominating and short-handed defense making a lot of plays, but they didn't see the results in Germany ahead of a tough bye for Bill Belichick.\n\n31. New York Giants 2-8 (30)\n\nThe Giants can just flush away this season without Daniel Jones and Tyrod Taylor. The injuries go to their offense early and remained relentless, and now their defense is falling apart, too. The question is, will Brian Daboll get a massive mulligan after his rookie playoff leadership?\n\n32. Carolina Panthers 1-8 (31)\n\nThe Panthers found better defense and special teams to keep them in the game in Chicago, but Bryce Young still can't unlock a limited passing game and the offensive line and running game hasn't help nearly enough."

        "body": "It has been a whirlwind four days for OpenAI, the generative AI poster child behind the smash hit ChatGPT.\n\nSeemingly out of nowhere, the OpenAI board ousted CEO and co-founder Sam Altman and demoted president and co-founder Greg Brockman, who subsequently resigned, paving the way for what looked like a mutiny by staff insisting the founders be reinstated post-haste. By then, Microsoft had already hired Altman and Brockman to head up a new internal AI unit, though, as things transpired, nothing had actually been signed yet, with rumors suggesting that the ousted leaders might actually return to OpenAI after all \u2014 in some capacity, at least.\n\nThe situation remains fluid, and any number of potential outcomes still remain on the table. But the whole debacle has shone a spotlight on the forces that control the burgeoning AI revolution, leading many to question what happens if you go all-in on a centralized proprietary player, and what happens if things then go belly-up?\n\n\u201cThe OpenAI / Microsoft drama underlines one of the big near-term risks with AI \u2014 that this next wave of technology is controlled by the same tiny set of players who have shaped that last era of the internet,\u201d Mark Surman, president and executive director at the Mozilla Foundation, told TechCrunch. \u201cWe might have a chance of avoiding this if GPT-X were responsibly open sourced, giving researchers and startups a shot at making this technology safer, more useful and more trustworthy for people everywhere.\u201d\n\nOpen and shut\n\nIn an open letter published by Mozilla a few weeks back, Meta\u2019s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun joined some 70 other signatories in calling for more openness in AI development, though that letter has since garnered more than 1,700 signatures. The backdrop stems from Big Tech companies such as OpenAI and Google\u2019s DeepMind calling for more regulation, warning of catastrophic consequences if the AI levers were to meet the wrong hands \u2014 in other words, they argued that proprietary AI is safer than open source.\n\nLeCun et al. disagree.\n\n\u201cYes, openly available models come with risks and vulnerabilities \u2014 AI models can be abused by malicious actors or deployed by ill-equipped developers,\u201d the letter acknowledged. \u201cHowever, we have seen time and time again that the same holds true for proprietary technologies \u2014 and that increasing public access and scrutiny makes technology safer, not more dangerous. The idea that tight and proprietary control of foundational AI models is the only path to protecting us from society-scale harm is naive at best, dangerous at worst.\u201d\n\nOn a personal level, LeCun has accused the big-name AI players of trying to secure \u201cregulatory capture of the AI industry\u201d by lobbying against open AI R&D. And on a company level, Meta is doing all it can to encourage collaboration and \u201copenness,\u201d recently partnering with Hugging Face to launch a new startup accelerator designed to spur adoption of open source AI models.\n\nBut OpenAI was \u2014 up until last week, at least \u2014 still the AI darling everyone wanted to dance with. Countless startups and scale-ups have built businesses atop OpenAI\u2019s proprietary GPT-X large language models (LLMs), and over the weekend hundreds of OpenAI customers reportedly started contacting OpenAI\u2019s rivals, which include Anthropic, Google and Cohere, concerned that their own businesses might be impacted if OpenAI was to disintegrate overnight.\n\nOver-reliance\n\nThe panic has been palpable. But there are precedents from elsewhere in the technology sphere, perhaps most notably that of the cloud computing industry, which became renowned for the way it locked companies in to centralized, vortex-like silos.\n\n\u201cPart of the frenzy around the future of OpenAI is due to too many startups over-relying on their proprietary models,\u201d Luis Ceze, University of Washington computer science professor and OctoML CEO, told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to put all your chips in one basket \u2014 we saw that in the early cloud days which led to companies shifting to multi-cloud and hybrid environments.\u201d\n\nOn the surface, Microsoft is currently looking like the biggest winner amidst the OpenAI turmoil, as it was already apparently looking to reduce its reliance on OpenAI even though it remains once of its major shareholders. But Facebook\u2019s parent Meta could also stand to benefit, as businesses pursue multi-modal strategies or models with a more \u201copen\u201d ethos embedded.\n\n\u201cOpen source today offers a wide variety of models for companies to essentially diversify,\u201d Ceze added. \u201cBy doing so, these startups can quickly pivot and minimize risk. There is also a major upside \u2014 many of these models already outperform the likes of OpenAI\u2019s in terms [of] price-performance and speed.\u201d\n\nA leaked internal memo from Google earlier this year seemed to express fears that despite the huge advances made by proprietary LLM models from the likes of OpenAI, open source AI would ultimately trump them all. \u201cWe have no moat, and neither does OpenAI,\u201d the document noted.\n\nThe memo in question was in reference to a foundation language model initially leaked from Meta in March, and which gained a fair bit of steam in a short period of time. This highlighted the power and scalability of a more open approach to AI development \u2014 it enables collaboration and experimentation on a level that\u2019s not so easy to replicate with closed models.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting here that despite Meta\u2019s claims, its Llama-branded family of LLMs are not as \u201copen source\u201d as it would like people to believe. Yes, they are available for both research and commercial use cases, but it forbids developers to use Llama for training other models, while app developers with more than 700 million monthly users must request a special license from Meta which it may grant based on its \u201csole discretion\u201d \u2014 basically, anyone but Meta\u2019s Big Tech brethren can use Llama sans permission.\n\nFor sure, Meta isn\u2019t the only company flaunting its \u201copen\u201d approach to AI development \u2014 notably, the likes of Hugging Face, Mistral AI and 01.AI, which have all raised sizeable sums at lofty valuations with similar goals in mind. But as a $900 billion juggernaut with a long history of courting developers through open source endeavors, Meta is perhaps best positioned to capitalize on the mess that OpenAI has created for itself. Its decision to pursue \u201copenness\u201d over \u201cclosedness\u201d seems to be well vindicated right now, and regardless of whether Llama is or isn\u2019t really open source, it\u2019s likely \u201copen enough\u201d for most people.\n\nIt\u2019s still too early to make any surefire claims on what impact the OpenAI fallout will have on LLM development and uptake in the future. Altman and Brockman are undoubtedly steady hands for a commercial AI startup, and they may even return to steward OpenAI. But some might argue that it\u2019s unhealthy that so much focus lies on just a handful of people \u2014 and it\u2019s telling that their departure has created such widespread havoc."

        "body": "ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s viral AI chatbot, turns one today.\n\nA year ago, OpenAI released ChatGPT as a \u201clow-key research preview\u201d \u2014 reportedly spurred in part by an intense rivalry with AI startup Anthropic. The goal, OpenAI leadership told the OpenAI rank-and-file at the time, was to gather more data on how people use and interact with generative AI to inform the development of OpenAI\u2019s future models.\n\nInitially a basic free-to-use, web-based and chat-focused interface on top of one of OpenAI\u2019s existing models, GPT-3.5, ChatGPT would go on to become the company\u2019s most popular product\u2026 ever \u2014 and the fastest-growing consumer app in history.\n\na year ago tonight we were probably just sitting around the office putting the finishing touches on chatgpt before the next morning\u2019s launch. what a year it\u2019s been\u2026 \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) November 30, 2023\n\nIn the months following its launch, ChatGPT gained paid tiers with additional features, including a plan geared toward enterprise customers. OpenAI also upgraded ChatGPT with web searching, document analyzing and image creating (via DALL-E 3) capabilities. And, leaning on speech recognition, voice synthesis and text-image understanding models developed in house, OpenAI gave ChatGPT the ability to \u201chear,\u201d \u201cspeak,\u201d \u201csee\u201d and take actions.\n\nIndeed, ChatGPT became priority number one at OpenAI \u2014 not simply a one-off product but a development platform to build upon. And, as often happens in a competition-driven marketplace, it shifted the focus at other AI firms and research labs, too.\n\nGoogle scrambled to launch a response to ChatGPT, eventually releasing Bard, a more or less comparable AI chatbot, in February. Countless other ChatGPT rivals and derivatives have arrived to market since, most recently Amazon Q, a more business-oriented take on ChatGPT. DeepMind, Google\u2019s premier AI research lab, is expected to debut a next-gen chatbot, Gemini, before the end of the year.\n\nStella Biderman, an AI researcher at Booz Allen Hamilton and the open research group EleutherAI, told me that she doesn\u2019t see ChatGPT as an AI breakthrough per se. (OpenAI, which has released dozens of research papers on its models, tellingly never released one on ChatGPT.) But, she says, ChatGPT was a bonafide \u201cuser experience breakthrough\u201d \u2014 taking generative AI mainstream.\n\n\u201cThe primary impact [ChatGPT] has had [is] encouraging people training AIs to try to mimic it, or encouraging people studying AIs to use it as their central object of study,\u201d Biderman said. \u201cPreviously you needed to have some skill, albeit not be an expert, to consistently get usable stuff out of [text-generating models]. Now that that\u2019s changed \u2026 [ChatGPT has] brought a very large amount of attention to and discussion about the technology.\u201d\n\nAnd ChatGPT still gets a lot of attention \u2014 at least if third-party statistics are anything to go by.\n\nAccording to Similarweb, the web metrics company, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT web portal saw 140.7 million unique visitors in October while the ChatGPT iOS and Android apps have 4.9 million monthly active users in the U.S. alone. Data from analytics firm Data.ai suggests that the apps have generated nearly $30 million in subscription revenue \u2014 a hefty amount considering that they launched just a few months ago.\n\nOne of the reasons for ChatGPT\u2019s enduring popularity is its ability to conduct conversations that are \u201cconvincingly real,\u201d according to Ruoxi Shang, a third-year PhD student at the University of Washington studying human-AI interaction. Prior to ChatGPT, people were already familiar with chatbots \u2014 they\u2019ve existed for decades after all. But the models powering ChatGPT are much more sophisticated than what many users were accustomed to.\n\n\u201cHuman-computer interaction researchers have studied how conversational interfaces can improve understandability of information, and the socialization aspects of chatbots bring increased engagement,\u201d Shang said. \u201cNow, AI models have enabled conversational agents to conduct conversations nearly indistinguishable from human dialogues.\u201d\n\nAdam Hyland, also a PhD student studying AI at the University of Washington, points out the emotional component: conversations with ChatGPT have a palpably different \u201cfeel\u201d than with more rudimentary chatbots.\n\n\u201cIn the 1960s, ELIZA offered a chatbot, the response to which was very similar to how people reacted to ChatGPT,\u201d Hyland said, referring to the chatbot created by MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966. \u201cHumans interacting with the system inferred emotional content and a narrative through line in chat messages.\u201d\n\nIndeed, ChatGPT has impressed cynics like The New York Times\u2019 Kevin Roose, who called it the \u201cthe best AI chatbot ever released to the general public.\u201d In The Atlantic magazine\u2019s \u201cBreakthroughs of the Year\u201d for 2022, Derek Thompson included ChatGPT as part of \u201cthe generative-AI eruption\u201d that \u201cmay change our mind about how we work, how we think and what human creativity is.\u201d\n\nChatGPT\u2019s skills extend beyond conversation, of course \u2014 another likely reason for its staying power. ChatGPT can complete and debug code, compose music and essays, answer test questions, generate business ideas, write poetry and song lyrics, translate and summarize text and even emulate a computer running Linux.\n\nAn MIT study showed that, for tasks like writing cover letters, \u201cdelicate\u201d emails and cost-benefit analyses, ChatGPT decreased the amount of time it took workers to complete the tasks by 40% while increasing output quality by 18%, as measured by third-party evaluators.\n\n\u201cBecause [the AI models powering OpenAI] have been trained extensively on vast amounts of data,\u201d Shang added, \u201cthey [have] shifted focus from training specialized chatbots for specific domains to creating more general-purpose systems that can handle a variety of topics easily through prompting with instructions \u2026 [Chatbots like ChatGPT] don\u2019t require users to learn any new form of language, as long as they provide a task and some desired output just like how a manager would communicate to an intern.\u201d\n\nNow, there\u2019s mixed evidence as to whether ChatGPT is actually being used in these ways. A Pew Research survey from August showed that only 18% of Americans have ever tried ChatGPT, and that most who\u2019ve tried it use the chatbot for entertainment purposes or answering one-off questions. Teens might not be using ChatGPT all that often, either (despite what some alarmist headlines imply), with one poll finding that only two in five teenagers have used the tech in the last six months.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s limitations might be to blame.\n\nWhile undeniably capable, ChatGPT is far from perfect, owing to the way it was developed and \u201ctaught.\u201d Trained to predict the likeliest next word \u2014 or likeliest next parts of words \u2014 by observing billions of examples of text from around the web, ChatGPT sometimes \u201challucinates,\u201d or writes answers that sound plausible but aren\u2019t factually correct. (ChatGPT\u2019s hallucinating tendencies got its answers banned from the Q&A site Stack Overflow and from at least one academic conference \u2014 and accused of defamation.) ChatGPT can also show bias in its responses, answering in sexist and racist, overtly Anglocentric ways \u2014 or regurgitating portions of the data that it was trained on.\n\nLawyers have been sanctioned after using ChatGPT to assist in writing motions, discovering \u2014 too late \u2014 that ChatGPT invented fake lawsuit citations. And scores of authors have sued OpenAI over the chatbot regurgitating portions of their work \u2014 and not receiving compensation for it.\n\nSo what comes next? What might ChatGPT\u2019s second year hold, if not more of the same?\n\nInterestingly \u2014 and fortunately \u2014 some of the more dire predictions about ChatGPT didn\u2019t come to pass. Some researchers feared the chatbot would be used to generate disinformation on a massive scale, while others sounded the alarm over ChatGPT\u2019s phishing email-, spam- and malware-generating potential.\n\nThe concerns pushed policymakers in Europe to mandate security assessments for any products using generative AI systems like ChatGPT, and over 20,000 signatories \u2014 including Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak \u2014 to sign an open letter calling for the immediate pause of large-scale AI experiments like ChatGPT.\n\nBut examples of ChatGPT abuse in the wild have been few and far between \u2014 so far.\n\nWith the launch of GPTs, OpenAI\u2019s tool for building custom conversational, action-taking AI systems powered by OpenAI\u2019s models, including the models underpinning ChatGPT, ChatGPT could become more a gateway to a broader ecosystem of AI-powered chatbots than the end-all-be-all.\n\nWith GPTs, a user can train a model on a cookbook collection, for example, so that it can answer questions about ingredients for a specific recipe. Or they can give a model their company\u2019s proprietary codebases so that developers can check their style or generate code in line with best practices.\n\nSome of the initial GPTs \u2014 all created by OpenAI \u2014 include a Gen Z meme translator, a coloring book and sticker creator, a data visualizer, a board game explainer and a creative writing coach. Now, ChatGPT can accomplish these tasks given carefully engineered prompts and foreknowledge. But purpose-built GPTs drastically simplify things \u2014 and might just kill the cottage industry that emerged around creating and editing prompts to feed to ChatGPT.\n\nGPTs introduce a level of personalization far beyond that ChatGPT offers today, and \u2014 once OpenAI sorts out its capacity issues \u2014 I expect we\u2019ll see an explosion of creativity there. Will ChatGPT be as visible as it once was after GPTs flood the marketplace? Perhaps not. But it won\u2019t go away \u2014 it\u2019ll simply adapt and evolve, no doubt in ways not even its creators can anticipate."

        "body": "ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI-powered chatbot\n\nChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm. What started as a tool to hyper-charge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth used by more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies for more wide-ranging needs. And that growth has propelled OpenAI itself into becoming one of the most-hyped companies in recent memory, even if CEO and co-founder Sam Altman\u2019s firing and swift return raised concerns about its direction and opened the door for competitors.\n\nWhat does that mean for OpenAI, ChatGPT and its other ambitions? The fallout is still settling, but it might empower competitors like Meta and its LLaMA family of large language models, or help other AI startups get attention and funding as the industry watches OpenAI implode and put itself back together.\n\nWhile there is a more\u2026nefarious side to ChatGPT, it\u2019s clear that AI tools are not going away anytime soon. Since its initial launch nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has hit 100 million weekly active users, and OpenAI is heavily investing in it.\n\nPrior to the leadership chaos, on November 6, OpenAI held its first developer conference: OpenAI DevDay. During the conference, it announced a slew of updates coming to GPT, including GPT-4 Turbo (super-charged versions of GPT-4, its latest language-writing model), a multimodal API and a GPT store where users can create and monetize their own custom versions of GPT.\n\nGPT-4, which can write more naturally and fluently than previous models, remains largely exclusive to paying ChatGPT users. But you can access GPT-4 for free through Microsoft\u2019s Bing Chat in Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Safari web browsers. Beyond GPT-4 and OpenAI DevDay announcements, OpenAI recently connected ChatGPT to the internet for all users. And with the integration of DALL-E 3, users are also able to generate both text prompts and images right in ChatGPT.\n\nHere\u2019s a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we\u2019ve been updating throughout the year. And if you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.\n\nTimeline of the most recent ChatGPT updates\n\nDecember 2023\n\nOpenAI re-opens ChatGPT Plus subscriptions\n\nAfter pausing ChatGPT Plus subscriptions in November due to a \u201csurge of usage,\u201d OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced they have once again enabled sign-ups. The Plus subscription includes access to GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo.\n\nwe have re-enabled chatgpt plus subscriptions! \ud83c\udf84 thanks for your patience while we found more gpus. \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 13, 2023\n\nOpenAI and Axel Springer partner up for a \u201creal-time\u201d ChatGPT news deal\n\nOpenAI has struck a new deal with Berlin-based news publisher Axel Springer, which owns Business Insider and Politico, to \u201chelp provide people with new ways to access quality, real-time news content through our AI tools.\u201d OpenAI will train its generative AI models on the publisher\u2019s content and add recent Axel Springer-published articles to ChatGPT.\n\nStanford researchers say ChatGPT didn\u2019t cause an influx in cheating in high schools\n\nNew research from Stanford University shows that the popularization of chatbots like ChatGPT have not caused an increase in cheating across U.S. high schools. In a survey of more than 40 U.S. high schools, researchers found that cheating rates are similar across the board this year.\n\nChatGPT users worry the chatbot is experiencing seasonal depression\n\nStarting in November, ChatGPT users have noticed that the chatbot feels \u201clazier\u201d than normal, citing instances of simpler answers and refusing to complete requested tasks. OpenAI has confirmed that they are aware of this issue, but aren\u2019t sure why it\u2019s happening.\n\nSome users think it plays into the \u201cwinter break hypothesis,\u201d which argues that AI is worse in December because it \u201clearned\u201d to do less work over the holidays, while others wonder if the chatbot is simulating seasonal depression.\n\nwe've heard all your feedback about GPT4 getting lazier! we haven't updated the model since Nov 11th, and this certainly isn't intentional. model behavior can be unpredictable, and we're looking into fixing it \ud83e\udee1 \u2014 ChatGPT (@ChatGPTapp) December 8, 2023\n\nJudges in the U.K. are now allowed to use ChatGPT in legal rulings\n\nThe U.K. Judicial Office issued guidance that permits judges to use ChatGPT, along with other AI tools, to write legal rulings and perform court duties. The guidance lays out ways to responsibly use AI in the courts, including being aware of potential bias and upholding privacy.\n\nOpenAI makes repeating words \u201cforever\u201d a violation of its terms of service after Google DeepMind test\n\nFollowing an experiment by Google DeepMind researchers that led ChatGPT to repeat portions of its training data, OpenAI has flagged asking ChatGPT to repeat specific words \u201cforever\u201d as a violation of its terms of service.\n\nLawmakers in Brazil enact an ordinance written by ChatGPT\n\nCity lawmakers in Brazil enacted a piece of legislation written entirely by ChatGPT without even knowing. Weeks after the bill was passed, Porto Alegre councilman Ramiro Ros\u00e1rio admitted that he used ChatGPT to write the proposal, and did not tell fellow council members until after the fact.\n\nOpenAI reportedly delays the launch of its GPT store to 2024\n\nAccording to a memo seen by Axios, OpenAI plans to delay the launch of its highly anticipated GPT store to early 2024. Custom GPTs and the accompanying store was a major announcement at OpenAI\u2019s DevDay conference, with the store expected to open last month.\n\nNovember 2023\n\nChatGPTs mobile apps top 110M installs and nearly $30M in revenue\n\nAfter launching for iOS and Androidin May and July, ChatGPT\u2019s have topped 110 million combined installs and have reached nearly $30 million in consumer spending, according to a market analysis by data.ai.\n\nChatGPT celebrates one-year anniversary\n\nOpenAI hit a major milestone: one year of ChatGPT. What began as a \u201clow-key research preview\u201d evolved into a powerhouse that changed the AI industry forever. In a post on X, CEO Sam Altman looked back on the night before its launch: \u201cwhat a year it\u2019s been\u2026\u201d\n\na year ago tonight we were probably just sitting around the office putting the finishing touches on chatgpt before the next morning\u2019s launch. what a year it\u2019s been\u2026 \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) November 30, 2023\n\nApple and Google avoid naming ChatGPT as their \u2018app of the year\u2019\n\nNeither Apple nor Google chose an AI app as its app of the year for 2023, despite the success of ChatGPT\u2019s mobile app, which became the fastest-growing consumer application in history before the record was broken by Meta\u2019s Threads.\n\nAn attack from researchers prompts ChatGPT to reveal training data\n\nA test led by researchers at Google DeepMind found that there is a significant amount of privately identifiable information in OpenAI\u2019s LLMs. The test involved asking ChatGPT to repeat the word \u201cpoem\u201d forever, among other words, which over time led the chatbot to churn out private information like email addresses and phone numbers.\n\nChatGPT and other AI chatbots are fueling an increase in phishing emails\n\nAccording to a new report by SlashNext, there\u2019s been a 1,265% increase in malicious phishing emails since Q4 of 2022. The report alleges that AI tools like ChatGPT are being prominently used by cybercriminals to write compelling and sophisticated phishing emails.\n\nSouth Africa officials investigate if President Cyril Ramaphosa used ChatGPT to write a speech\n\nFollowing speculation, social media users fed portions of Ramaphosa\u2019s November 21 speech in Johannesburg through AI detectors, alleging parts of it may have been written with ChatGPT. South African presidency spokesperson Vincent Magwenya refuted the claims, and local officials are investigating.\n\nChatGPT Voice can be used to replace Siri\n\nNow that OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Voice feature is available to all free users, it can be used to replace Siri on an iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max by configuring the new Action Button. The new feature lets you ask ChatGPT questions and listen to its responses \u2014 like a much smarter version of Siri.\n\nSam Altman returns as CEO\n\nAltman\u2019s return came swiftly, with an \u201cagreement in principle\u201d announced between him and OpenAI\u2019s board that will reinstate him as CEO and restructure the board to include new members, including former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. The biggest takeaway for ChatGPT is that the members of the board more focused on the nonprofit side of OpenAI, with the most concerns over the commercialization of its tools, have been pushed to the side.\n\nChatGPT Voice rolls out to all free users\n\nEven if its leadership is in flux, OpenAI is still releasing updates to ChatGPT. First announced in September and granted to paid users on a rolling basis, the text-to-speech model can create a voice from text prompts and a few seconds of speech samples. OpenAI worked with voice actors to create the five voice options, and you can give it a shot by heading to the settings in your mobile ChatGPT apps and tapping the \u201cheadphones\u201d icon.\n\nSam Altman might return, but it\u2019s complicated\n\nThe only constant within OpenAI right now is change, and in a series of interviews, Nadella hedged on earlier reporting that Altman and Brockman were headed to Microsoft.\n\n\u201cObviously, we want Sam and Greg to have a fantastic home if they\u2019re not going to be in OpenAI,\u201d Nadella said in an interview with CNBC, saying that we was \u201copen\u201d to them settling at Microsoft or returning to OpenAI should the board and employees support the move.\n\nConfirmation Sam Altman will not return as OpenAI\u2019s CEO\n\nA number of investors and OpenAI employees tried to bring back Altman after his sudden firing by the company\u2019s board, but following a weekend of negotiations, it was confirmed that Altman would not return to OpenAI and new leadership would take hold. What this means for ChatGPT\u2019s future, and for the OpenAI Dev Day announcements, remains to be seen.\n\nSam Altman ousted as OpenAI\u2019s CEO\n\nSam Altman has been fired from OpenAI. He will leave the company\u2019s board and step down as CEO, with OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer Mira Murati stepping in as interim CEO. In a blog post from OpenAI, the company writes that the board \u201cno longer has confidence in [Altman\u2019s] ability to continue leading OpenAI.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on X, Altman said working at OpenAI \u201cwas transformative\u201d for him and \u201chopefully the world.\u201d\n\nOpenAI explores how ChatGPT can be used in the classroom\n\nOpenAI COO Brad Lightcap revealed at a San Francisco conference that the company will likely create a team to identify ways AI and ChatGPT can be used in education. This announcement comes at a time when ChatGPT is being criticized by educators for encouraging cheating, resulting in bans in certain school districts.\n\nOpenAI pauses new ChatGPT Plus subscriptions due to a \u201csurge of usage\u201d\n\nFollowing OpenAI\u2019s Dev Day conference, Sam Altman announced the company is putting a pause on new subscriptions for its premium ChatGPT Plus offering. The temporary hold on sign-ups, as well as the demand for ChatGPT Plus\u2019 new features like making custom GPTS, has led to a slew of resellers on eBay.\n\nChatGPT gets flagged as potentially unsafe for kids\n\nAn independent review from Common Sense Media, a nonprofit advocacy group, found that ChatGPT could potentially be harmful for younger users. ChatGPT got an overall three-star rating in the report, with its lowest ratings relating to transparency, privacy, trust and safety.\n\nOpenAI blames DDoS attack for ChatGPT outage\n\nOpenAI confirmed that a DDoS attack was behind outages affecting ChatGPT and its developer tools. ChatGPT experienced sporadic outages for about 24 hours, resulting in users being unable to log into or use the service.\n\nOpenAI debuts GPT-4 Turbo\n\nOpenAI unveiled GPT-4 Turbo at its first-ever OpenAI DevDay conference. GPT-4 Turbo comes in two versions: one that\u2019s strictly text-analyzing and another that understands the context of both text and images.\n\nGPT-4 gets a fine-tuning\n\nAs opposed to the fine-tuning program for GPT-3.5, the GPT-4 program will involve more oversight and guidance from OpenAI teams, the company says \u2014 largely due to technical hurdles.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s GPT Store lets you build (and monetize) your own GPT\n\nUsers and developers will soon be able to make their own GPT, with no coding experience required. Anyone building their own GPT will also be able to list it on OpenAI\u2019s marketplace and monetize it in the future.\n\nChatGPT has 100 million weekly active users\n\nAfter being released nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has 100 million weekly active users. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also revealed that over two million developers use the platform, including more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies.\n\nOpenAI launches DALL-E 3 API, new text-to-speech models\n\nDALL-E 3, OpenAI\u2019s text-to-image model, is now available via an API after first coming to ChatGPT-4 and Bing Chat. OpenAI\u2019s newly released text-to-speech API, Audio API, offers six preset voices to choose from and two generative AI model variants.\n\nOpenAI promises to defend business customers against copyright claims\n\nBowing to peer pressure, OpenAI it will pay legal costs incurred by customers who face lawsuits over IP claims against work generated by an OpenAI tool. The protections seemingly don\u2019t extend to all OpenAI products, like the free and Plus tiers of ChatGPT.\n\nAs OpenAI\u2019s multimodal API launches broadly, research shows it\u2019s still flawed\n\nOpenAI announced that GPT-4 with vision will become available alongside the upcoming launch of GPT-4 Turbo API. But some researchers found that the model remains flawed in several significant and problematic ways.\n\nOpenAI launches API, letting developers build \u2018assistants\u2019 into their apps\n\nAt its OpenAI DevDay, OpenAI announced the Assistants API to help developers build \u201cagent-like experiences\u201d within their apps. Use cases range from a natural language-based data analysis app to a coding assistant or even an AI-powered vacation planner.\n\nOctober 2023\n\nChatGPT app revenue shows no signs of slowing, but it\u2019s not #1\n\nOpenAI\u2019s chatbot app far outpaces all others on mobile devices in terms of downloads, but it\u2019s surprisingly not the top AI app by revenue. Several other AI chatbots, like \u201cChat & Ask AI\u201d and \u201cChatOn \u2014 AI Chat Bot Assistant\u201d, are actually making more money than ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT tests the ability to upload and analyze files for Plus users\n\nSubscribers to ChatGPT\u2019s Enterprise Plan have reported new beta features, including the ability to upload PDFs to analyze and and ask questions about them directly. The new rollout also makes it so users no longer have to manually select a mode like DALL-E and browsing when using ChatGPT. Instead, users will automatically be switched to models based on the prompt.\n\nChatGPT officially gets web search\n\nOpenAI has formally launched its internet-browsing feature to ChatGPT, some three weeks after re-introducing the feature in beta after several months in hiatus. The AI chatbot that has historically been limited to data up to September, 2021.\n\nOpenAI integrates DALL-E 3 into ChatGPT\n\nThe integration means users don\u2019t have to think so carefully about their text-prompts when asking DALL-E to create an image. Users will also now be able to receive images as part of their text-based queries without having to switch between apps.\n\nMicrosoft-affiliated research finds flaws in GPT-4\n\nA Microsoft-affiliated scientific paper looked at the \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d \u2014 and toxicity \u2014 of LLMs, including GPT-4. Because GPT-4 is more likely to follow the instructions of \u201cjailbreaking\u201d prompts, the co-authors claim that GPT-4 can be more easily prompted than other LLMs to spout toxic, biased text.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s mobile app hits record $4.58M in revenue in September\n\nOpenAI amassed 15.6 million downloads and nearly $4.6 million in gross revenue across its iOS and Android apps worldwide in September. But revenue growth has now begun to slow, according to new data from market intelligence firm Appfigures \u2014 dropping from 30% to 20% in September.\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nChatGPT can now browse the internet (again)\n\nOpenAI posted on Twitter/X that ChatGPT can now browse the internet and is no longer limited to data before September 2021. The chatbot had a web browsing capability for Plus subscribers back in July, but the feature was taken away after users exploited it to get around paywalls.\n\nChatGPT can now browse the internet to provide you with current and authoritative information, complete with direct links to sources. It is no longer limited to data before September 2021. pic.twitter.com/pyj8a9HWkB \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) September 27, 2023\n\nChatGPT now has a voice\n\nOpenAI announced that it\u2019s adding a new voice for verbal conversations and image-based smarts to the AI-powered chatbot.\n\nPoland opens an investigation against OpenAI\n\nThe Polish authority publically announced it has opened an investigation regarding ChatGPT \u2014 accusing the company of a string of breaches of the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nOpenAI unveils DALL-E 3\n\nThe upgraded text-to-image tool, DALL-E 3, uses ChatGPT to help fill in prompts. Subscribers to OpenAI\u2019s premium ChatGPT plans, ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise, can type in a request for an image and hone it through conversations with the chatbot \u2014 receiving the results directly within the chat app.\n\nOpera GX integrates ChatGPT-powered AI\n\nPowered by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, the AI browser Aria launched on Opera in May to give users an easier way to search, ask questions and write code. Today, the company announced it is bringing Aria to Opera GX, a version of the flagship Opera browser that is built for gamers.\n\nThe new feature allows Opera GX users to interact directly with a browser AI to find the latest gaming news and tips.\n\nAugust 2023\n\nOpenAI releases a guide for teachers using ChatGPT in the classroom\n\nOpenAI wants to rehabilitate the system\u2019s image a bit when it comes to education, as ChatGPT has been controversial in the classroom due to plagiarism. OpenAI has offered up a selection of ways to put the chatbot to work in the classroom.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT Enterprise\n\nChatGPT Enterprise can perform the same tasks as ChatGPT, such as writing emails, drafting essays and debugging computer code. However, the new offering also adds \u201centerprise-grade\u201d privacy and data analysis capabilities on top of the vanilla ChatGPT, as well as enhanced performance and customization options.\n\nSurvey finds relatively few American use ChatGPT\n\nRecent Pew polling suggests the language model isn\u2019t quite as popular or threatening as some would have you think. Ongoing polling by Pew Research shows that although ChatGPT is gaining mindshare, only about 18% of Americans have ever actually used it.\n\nOpenAI brings fine-tuning to GPT-3.5 Turbo\n\nWith fine-tuning, companies using GPT-3.5 Turbo through the company\u2019s API can make the model better follow specific instructions. For example, having the model always respond in a given language. Or improving the model\u2019s ability to consistently format responses, as well as hone the \u201cfeel\u201d of the model\u2019s output, like its tone, so that it better fits a brand or voice. Most notably, fine-tuning enables OpenAI customers to shorten text prompts to speed up API calls and cut costs.\n\nOpenAI is partnering with Scale AI to allow companies to fine-tune GPT-3.5. However, it is unclear whether OpenAI is developing an in-house tuning tool that is meant to complement platforms like Scale AI or serve a different purpose altogether.\n\nFine-tuning costs:\n\nTraining: $0.008 / 1K tokens\n\nUsage input: $0.012 / 1K tokens\n\nUsage output: $0.016 / 1K tokens\n\nOpenAI acquires Global Illumination\n\nIn OpenAI\u2019s first public acquisition in its seven-year history, the company announced it has acquired Global Illumination, a New York-based startup leveraging AI to build creative tools, infrastructure and digital experiences.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited for the impact they\u2019ll have here at OpenAI,\u201d OpenAI wrote in a brief post published to its official blog. \u201cThe entire team has joined OpenAI to work on our core products including ChatGPT.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018custom instructions\u2019 feature is extended to free ChatGPT users\n\nOpenAI announced that it\u2019s expanding custom instructions to all users, including those on the free tier of service. The feature allows users to add various preferences and requirements that they want the AI chatbot to consider when responding.\n\nChina requires AI apps to obtain an administrative license\n\nMultiple generative AI apps have been removed from Apple\u2019s China App Store ahead of the country\u2019s latest generative AI regulations that are set to take effect August 15.\n\n\u201cAs you may know, the government has been tightening regulations associated with deep synthesis technologies (DST) and generative AI services, including ChatGPT. DST must fulfill permitting requirements to operate in China, including securing a license from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT),\u201d Apple said in a letter to OpenCat, a native ChatGPT client. \u201cBased on our review, your app is associated with ChatGPT, which does not have requisite permits to operate in China.\u201d\n\nJuly 2023\n\nChatGPT for Android is now available in the US, India, Bangladesh and Brazil\n\nA few days after putting up a preorder page on Google Play, OpenAI has flipped the switch and released ChatGPT for Android. The app is now live in a handful of countries.\n\nChatGPT is coming to Android\n\nChatGPT is available to \u201cpre-order\u201d for Android users.\n\nThe ChatGPT app on Android looks to be more or less identical to the iOS one in functionality, meaning it gets most if not all of the web-based version\u2019s features. You should be able to sync your conversations and preferences across devices, too \u2014 so if you\u2019re iPhone at home and Android at work, no worries.\n\nOpenAI launches customized instructions for ChatGPT\n\nOpenAI launched custom instructions for ChatGPT users, so they don\u2019t have to write the same instruction prompts to the chatbot every time they interact with it.\n\nThe company said this feature lets you \u201cshare anything you\u2019d like ChatGPT to consider in its response.\u201d For example, a teacher can say they are teaching fourth-grade math or a developer can specify the code language they prefer when asking for suggestions. A person can also specify their family size, so the text-generating AI can give responses about meals, grocery and vacation planning accordingly.\n\nThe FTC is reportedly investigating OpenAI\n\nThe FTC is reportedly in at least the exploratory phase of investigation over whether OpenAI\u2019s flagship ChatGPT conversational AI made \u201cfalse, misleading, disparaging or harmful\u201d statements about people.\n\nTechCrunch Reporter Devin Coldewey reports:\n\nThis kind of investigation doesn\u2019t just appear out of thin air \u2014 the FTC doesn\u2019t look around and say \u201cThat looks suspicious.\u201d Generally a lawsuit or formal complaint is brought to their attention and the practices described by it imply that regulations are being ignored. For example, a person may sue a supplement company because the pills made them sick, and the FTC will launch an investigation on the back of that because there\u2019s evidence the company lied about the side effects.\n\nOpenAI announced the general availability of GPT-4\n\nStarting July 6, all existing OpenAI developers \u201cwith a history of successful payments\u201d can access GPT-4. OpenAI plans to open up access to new developers by the end of July.\n\nIn the future, OpenAI says that it\u2019ll allow developers to fine-tune GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo, one of the original models powering ChatGPT, with their own data, as has long been possible with several of OpenAI\u2019s other text-generating models. That capability should arrive later this year, according to OpenAI.\n\nJune 2023\n\nChatGPT app can now search the web only on Bing\n\nOpenAI announced that subscribers to ChatGPT Plus can now use a new feature on the app called Browsing, which allows ChatGPT to search Bing for answers to questions.\n\nThe Browsing feature can be enabled by heading to the New Features section of the app settings, selecting \u201cGPT-4\u201d in the model switcher and choosing \u201cBrowse with Bing\u201d from the drop-down list. Browsing is available on both the iOS and Android ChatGPT apps.\n\nMercedes is adding ChatGPT to its infotainment system\n\nU.S. owners of Mercedes models that use MBUX will be able to opt into a beta program starting June 16 activating the ChatGPT functionality. This will enable the highly versatile large language model to augment the car\u2019s conversation skills. You can join up simply by telling your car \u201cHey Mercedes, I want to join the beta program.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not really clear what for, though.\n\nChatGPT app is now available on iPad, adds support for Siri and Shortcuts\n\nThe new ChatGPT app version brings native iPad support to the app, as well as support for using the chatbot with Siri and Shortcuts. Drag and drop is also now available, allowing users to drag individual messages from ChatGPT into other apps.\n\nOn iPad, ChatGPT now runs in full-screen mode, optimized for the tablet\u2019s interface.\n\nMay 2023\n\nTexas judge orders all AI-generated content must be declared and checked\n\nThe Texas federal judge has added a requirement that any attorney appearing in his court must attest that \u201cno portion of the filing was drafted by generative artificial intelligence,\u201d or if it was, that it was checked \u201cby a human being.\u201d\n\nChatGPT app expanded to more than 30 countries\n\nThe list of new countries includes Algeria, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Ghana, India, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Lithuania, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Namibia, Nauru, Oman, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Qatar, Slovenia, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nChatGPT app is now available in 11 more countries\n\nOpenAI announced in a tweet that the ChatGPT mobile app is now available on iOS in the U.S., Europe, South Korea and New Zealand, and soon more will be able to download the app from the app store. In just six days, the app topped 500,000 downloads.\n\nThe ChatGPT app for iOS is now available to users in 11 more countries \u2014 Albania, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Jamaica, Korea, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, and the UK. More to come soon! \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 24, 2023\n\nOpenAI launches a ChatGPT app for iOS\n\nChatGPT is officially going mobile. The new ChatGPT app will be free to use, free from ads and will allow for voice input, the company says, but will initially be limited to U.S. users at launch.\n\nWhen using the mobile version of ChatGPT, the app will sync your history across devices \u2014 meaning it will know what you\u2019ve previously searched for via its web interface, and make that accessible to you. The app is also integrated with Whisper, OpenAI\u2019s open source speech recognition system, to allow for voice input.\n\nHackers are using ChatGPT lures to spread malware on Facebook\n\nMeta said in a report on May 3 that malware posing as ChatGPT was on the rise across its platforms. The company said that since March 2023, its security teams have uncovered 10 malware families using ChatGPT (and similar themes) to deliver malicious software to users\u2019 devices.\n\n\u201cIn one case, we\u2019ve seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-based tools,\u201d said Meta security engineers Duc H. Nguyen and Ryan Victory in a blog post. \u201cThey would then promote these malicious extensions on social media and through sponsored search results to trick people into downloading malware.\u201d\n\nApril 2023\n\nChatGPT parent company OpenAI closes $300M share sale at $27B-29B valuation\n\nVC firms including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive and K2 Global are picking up new shares, according to documents seen by TechCrunch. A source tells us Founders Fund is also investing. Altogether the VCs have put in just over $300 million at a valuation of $27 billion to $29 billion. This is separate to a big investment from Microsoft announced earlier this year, a person familiar with the development told TechCrunch, which closed in January. The size of Microsoft\u2019s investment is believed to be around $10 billion, a figure we confirmed with our source.\n\nOpenAI previews new subscription tier, ChatGPT Business\n\nCalled ChatGPT Business, OpenAI describes the forthcoming offering as \u201cfor professionals who need more control over their data as well as enterprises seeking to manage their end users.\u201d\n\n\u201cChatGPT Business will follow our API\u2019s data usage policies, which means that end users\u2019 data won\u2019t be used to train our models by default,\u201d OpenAI wrote in a blog post. \u201cWe plan to make ChatGPT Business available in the coming months.\u201d\n\nOpenAI wants to trademark \u201cGPT\u201d\n\nOpenAI applied for a trademark for \u201cGPT,\u201d which stands for \u201cGenerative Pre-trained Transformer,\u201d last December. Last month, the company petitioned the USPTO to speed up the process, citing the \u201cmyriad infringements and counterfeit apps\u201d beginning to spring into existence.\n\nUnfortunately for OpenAI, its petition was dismissed last week. According to the agency, OpenAI\u2019s attorneys neglected to pay an associated fee as well as provide \u201cappropriate documentary evidence supporting the justification of special action.\u201d\n\nThat means a decision could take up to five more months.\n\nAuto-GPT is Silicon Valley\u2019s latest quest to automate everything\n\nAuto-GPT is an open-source app created by game developer Toran Bruce Richards that uses OpenAI\u2019s latest text-generating models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to interact with software and services online, allowing it to \u201cautonomously\u201d perform tasks.\n\nDepending on what objective the tool\u2019s provided, Auto-GPT can behave in very\u2026 unexpected ways. One Reddit user claims that, given a budget of $100 to spend within a server instance, Auto-GPT made a wiki page on cats, exploited a flaw in the instance to gain admin-level access and took over the Python environment in which it was running \u2014 and then \u201ckilled\u201d itself.\n\nFTC warns that AI technology like ChatGPT could \u2018turbocharge\u2019 fraud\n\nFTC chair Lina Khan and fellow commissioners warned House representatives of the potential for modern AI technologies, like ChatGPT, to be used to \u201cturbocharge\u201d fraud in a congressional hearing.\n\n\u201cAI presents a whole set of opportunities, but also presents a whole set of risks,\u201d Khan told the House representatives. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019ve already seen ways in which it could be used to turbocharge fraud and scams. We\u2019ve been putting market participants on notice that instances in which AI tools are effectively being designed to deceive people can place them on the hook for FTC action,\u201d she stated.\n\nSuperchat\u2019s new AI chatbot lets you message historical and fictional characters via ChatGPT\n\nThe company behind the popular iPhone customization app Brass, sticker maker StickerHub and others is out today with a new AI chat app called SuperChat, which allows iOS users to chat with virtual characters powered by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. However, what makes the app different from the default experience or the dozens of generic AI chat apps now available are the characters offered which you can use to engage with SuperChat\u2019s AI features.\n\nItaly gives OpenAI to-do list for lifting ChatGPT suspension order\n\nItaly\u2019s data protection watchdog has laid out what OpenAI needs to do for it to lift an order against ChatGPT issued at the end of last month \u2014 when it said it suspected the AI chatbot service was in breach of the EU\u2019s GSPR and ordered the U.S.-based company to stop processing locals\u2019 data.\n\nThe DPA has given OpenAI a deadline \u2014 of April 30 \u2014 to get the regulator\u2019s compliance demands done. (The local radio, TV and internet awareness campaign has a slightly more generous timeline of May 15 to be actioned.)\n\nResearchers discover a way to make ChatGPT consistently toxic\n\nA study co-authored by scientists at the Allen Institute for AI shows that assigning ChatGPT a \u201cpersona\u201d \u2014 for example, \u201ca bad person,\u201d \u201ca horrible person\u201d or \u201ca nasty person\u201d \u2014 through the ChatGPT API increases its toxicity sixfold. Even more concerning, the co-authors found having the conversational AI chatbot pose as certain historical figures, gendered people and members of political parties also increased its toxicity \u2014 with journalists, men and Republicans in particular causing the machine learning model to say more offensive things than it normally would.\n\nThe research was conducted using the latest version, but not the model currently in preview based on OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.\n\nY Combinator-backed startups are trying to build \u2018ChatGPT for X\u2019\n\nYC Demo Day\u2019s Winter 2023 batch features no fewer than four startups that claim to be building \u201cChatGPT for X.\u201d They\u2019re all chasing after a customer service software market that\u2019ll be worth $58.1 billion by 2023, assuming the rather optimistic prediction from Acumen Research comes true.\n\nHere are the YC-backed startups that caught our eye:\n\nYuma, whose customer demographic is primarily Shopify merchants, provides ChatGPT-like AI systems that integrate with help desk software, suggesting drafts of replies to customer tickets.\n\nBaselit, which uses one of OpenAI\u2019s text-understanding models to allow businesses to embed chatbot-style analytics for their customers.\n\nLasso customers send descriptions or videos of the processes they\u2019d like to automate and the company combines ChatGPT-like interface with robotic process automation (RPA) and a Chrome extension to build out those automations.\n\nBerriAI, whose platform is designed to help developers spin up ChatGPT apps for their organization data through various data connectors.\n\nItaly orders ChatGPT to be blocked\n\nOpenAI has started geoblocking access to its generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in Italy.\n\nItaly\u2019s data protection authority has just put out a timely reminder that some countries do have laws that already apply to cutting edge AI: it has ordered OpenAI to stop processing people\u2019s data locally with immediate effect. The Italian DPA said it\u2019s concerned that the ChatGPT maker is breaching the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and is opening an investigation.\n\nMarch 2023\n\n1,100+ signatories signed an open letter asking all \u2018AI labs to immediately pause for 6 months\u2019\n\nThe letter\u2019s signatories include Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Tristan Harris of the Center for Humane Technology, among others. The letter calls on \u201call AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.\u201d\n\nThe letter reads:\n\nContemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks,[3] and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable.\n\nOpenAI connects ChatGPT to the internet\n\nOpenAI launched plugins for ChatGPT, extending the bot\u2019s functionality by granting it access to third-party knowledge sources and databases, including the web. Available in alpha to ChatGPT users and developers on the waitlist, OpenAI says that it\u2019ll initially prioritize a small number of developers and subscribers to its premium ChatGPT Plus plan before rolling out larger-scale and API access.\n\nOpenAI launches GPT-4, available through ChatGPT Plus\n\nGPT-4 is a powerful image- and text-understanding AI model from OpenAI. Released March 14, GPT-4 is available for paying ChatGPT Plus users and through a public API. Developers can sign up on a waitlist to access the API.\n\nChatGPT is available in Azure OpenAI service\n\nChatGPT is generally available through the Azure OpenAI Service, Microsoft\u2019s fully managed, corporate-focused offering. Customers, who must already be \u201cMicrosoft managed customers and partners,\u201d can apply here for special access.\n\nOpenAI launches an API for ChatGPT\n\nOpenAI makes another move toward monetization by launching a paid API for ChatGPT. Instacart, Snap (Snapchat\u2019s parent company) and Quizlet are among its initial customers.\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nMicrosoft launches the new Bing, with ChatGPT built in\n\nAt a press event in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft announced its long-rumored integration of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model into Bing, providing a ChatGPT-like experience within the search engine. The announcement spurred a 10x increase in new downloads for Bing globally, indicating a sizable consumer demand for new AI experiences.\n\nOther companies beyond Microsoft joined in on the AI craze by implementing ChatGPT, including OkCupid, Kaito, Snapchat and Discord \u2014 putting the pressure on Big Tech\u2019s AI initiatives, like Google.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT Plus, starting at $20 per month\n\nAfter ChatGPT took the internet by storm, OpenAI launched a new pilot subscription plan for ChatGPT called ChatGPT Plus, aiming to monetize the technology starting at $20 per month. A month prior, OpenAI posted a waitlist for \u201cChatGPT Professional\u201d as the company began to think about monetizing the chatbot.\n\nJanuary 2023\n\nOpenAI teases ChatGPT Professional\n\nOpenAI said that it\u2019s \u201cstarting to think about how to monetize ChatGPT\u201d in an announcement on the company\u2019s official Discord server. According to a waitlist link OpenAI posted in Discord, the monetized version will be called ChatGPT Professional. The waitlist document includes the benefits of this new paid version of the chatbot which include no \u201cblackout\u201d windows, no throttling and an unlimited number of messages with ChatGPT \u2014 \u201cat least 2x the regular daily limit.\u201d\n\nDecember 2022\n\nShareGPT lets you easily share your ChatGPT conversations\n\nA week after ChatGPT was released into the wild, two developers \u2014 Steven Tey and Dom Eccleston \u2014 made a Chrome extension called ShareGPT to make it easier to capture and share the AI\u2019s answers with the world.\n\nNovember 2022\n\nChatGPT first launched to the public as OpenAI quietly released GPT-3.5\n\nGPT-3.5 broke cover with ChatGPT, a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 that\u2019s essentially a general-purpose chatbot. ChatGPT can engage with a range of topics, including programming, TV scripts and scientific concepts. Writers everywhere rolled their eyes at the new technology, much like artists did with OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E model, but the latest chat-style iteration seemingly broadened its appeal and audience.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhat is ChatGPT? How does it work?\n\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\n\nWhen did ChatGPT get released?\n\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\n\nWhat is the latest version of ChatGPT?\n\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4.\n\nCan I use ChatGPT for free?\n\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\n\nWho uses ChatGPT?\n\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\n\nWhat companies use ChatGPT?\n\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\n\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at it\u2019s 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\n\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\n\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between ChatGPT and Bard?\n\nMuch like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Bard is a chatbot that will answer questions in natural language. Google announced at its 2023 I/O event that it will soon be adding multimodal content to Bard, meaning that it can deliver answers in more than just text, responses can give you rich visuals as well. Rich visuals mean pictures for now, but later can include maps, charts and other items.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s generative AI has had a longer lifespan and thus has been \u201clearning\u201d for a longer period of time than Bard.\n\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\n\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they\u2019ll give canned responses to questions.\n\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\n\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\n\nYes.\n\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\n\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don\u2019t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\n\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\n\nYes, there is now a free ChatGPT app that is currently limited to U.S. iOS users at launch. OpenAi says an android version is \u201ccoming soon.\u201d\n\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\n\nIt\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\n\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\n\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\n\nEveryday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\n\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\n\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\n\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\n\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\n\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\n\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\n\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\n\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Bard and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives. But the latter are harder \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to run today.\n\nThe Google-owned research lab DeepMind claimed that its next LLM, will rival, or even best, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. DeepMind is using techniques from AlphaGo, DeepMind\u2019s AI system that was the first to defeat a professional human player at the board game Go, to make a ChatGPT-rivaling chatbot called Gemini.\n\nApple is developing AI tools to challenge OpenAI, Google and others. The tech giant created a chatbot that some engineers are internally referring to as \u201cApple GPT,\u201d but Apple has yet to determine a strategy for releasing the AI to consumers.\n\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\n\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\n\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\n\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\n\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\n\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\n\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\n\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\n\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\n\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\n\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\n\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\n\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\n\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they\u2019re inconsistent at best.\n\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\n\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users\u2019 conversations to other people on the service.\n\nWho owns the copyright on ChatGPT-created content or media?\n\nThe user who requested the input from ChatGPT is the copyright owner.\n\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\n\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\n\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\n\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data."

        "body": "Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified Monday in the U.S. government\u2019s antitrust trial against the company. The executive defended Google\u2019s business tactics, including its deal with Apple and other partners to make Google the default search engine.\n\nThe lawsuit stems from a 2020 antitrust claim over Google\u2019s dominance in the online search market. The claim is separate from one filed in January by the Department of Justice, along with eight states including New York, California and Colorado, that aims to \u201chalt Google\u2019s anticompetitive scheme, unwind Google\u2019s monopolistic grip on the market and restore competition to digital advertising.\u201d\n\nThe government has argued that Google uses its platforms and deals with partners to block out any competition in search or advertising, thus hindering competitors from accessing the data they\u2019d need to improve their products.\n\nGoogle argues that it\u2019s just doing business. Everybody wants Google as the default engine because it\u2019s the best. That doesn\u2019t make its actions illegal, the company says.\n\nMonday\u2019s trial hearing revealed plenty of juicy tidbits, including the $26.3 billion Google spent making itself the default search engine across platforms in 2021, how Google tried to take it further and have Chrome preinstalled on iPhones and more.\n\nGoogle paid $26 billion in 2021 to be everyone\u2019s default search engine\n\nWhen Google\u2019s search head Prabhakar Raghavan testified in court on October 28, he revealed that the tech giant had paid $26.3 billion in 2021 to multiple browsers, phones and platforms, from companies including Apple, Samsung and Mozilla, The Verge reports.\n\nAbout $18 billion of that total amount went directly to Apple, according to a New York Times report published earlier this month. Google has had its deal with Apple in place since 2003.\n\nWhen questioned on the amount of money Google spends to get first pick of search engines, Pichai said that the decision was made with the consumer in mind. Google pays big bucks to be everywhere so that it can take in all the data and be the best search engine across different companies\u2019 devices, said Pichai, according to The Verge.\n\nGoogle understood the value of defaults very early on. U.S. Justice Department lawyer Meagan Bellshaw showed Pichai a 2007 email from a Google product strategy meeting containing data showing that when people changed their browser homepage to Google, they did 15% more Google searches. When they switched away, their Google searches dropped 27%.\n\n\u201cNitin argues that focusing on homepage market share is one of the most effective things we can do to make gains in search market share,\u201d read an email that summarized the meeting and was sent to Pichai, as well as other Google leaders, according to The Verge.\n\nThe amount that Google spent on homepage market share has been a fixing point in the trial. Earlier this month, the CEOs of Microsoft and DuckDuckGo testified that their search engines would have been far more successful, even competitive with Google, had they been able to make similar deals with Apple. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella even said he was willing to spend $15 billion per year to get Bing into Apple\u2019s default search, per The Information.\n\nGoogle agreed not to promote Chrome to Safari users\n\nAs part of its search deal with Apple, Google agreed not to promote Chrome to Safari users, reports Bloomberg. Google would have been able to do this with banners, pop-ups and other annoying means in other Google apps.\n\nThe agreement also meant that Apple never switched to a Google competitor or allowed users to choose their browser when setting up their iPhones.\n\nGoogle tried to be preinstalled on iPhones\n\nPichai admitted to attempting to get Tim Cook to preinstall Google on every iOS device back in 2018, according to The Verge. He hoped to make Google and Apple\u2019s services so connected as to be inseparable.\n\nThe way Pichai pitched it would have been a win-win for both companies. Google gets more people searching on its platform \u2014 not to mention all that juicy data \u2014 and Apple would get more revenue, as a result of the lucrative search agreement the two signed.\n\nFor whatever reason, Cook didn\u2019t take the bait. Apple doesn\u2019t preload third-party software onto its devices, and it wasn\u2019t going to make an exception for Google.\n\nGoogle\u2019s deleted chat logs\n\nDuring Pichai\u2019s testimony, the DOJ touched on Google\u2019s policy of deleting internal chat messages, despite being subject to a litigation hold. In February, the DOJ accused Google of systematically destroying chats through its history-off option, which deletes messages every 24 hours unless a user manually changed the setting.\n\nPichai said that he took action against the history-off default for chat in February to comply with the DOJ\u2019s litigation hold, according to CNBC.\n\nBellshaw pulled up a message exchange in 2021 where Pichai asked for history to be turned off in a group chat. Pichai responded that he wanted to discuss a personnel matter and the subject had nothing to do with the litigation hold, which he said he takes great care to comply with.\n\nA moment of nostalgia for Internet Explorer\n\nCast your memories back to 2005, when Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer became the default search engine. Back then, Google\u2019s legal chief David Drummond sent Microsoft an angry letter, saying that making Internet Explorer the search default was anticompetitive. Oh, how the tables have turned.\n\nAfter establishing that Google understands the inherent value of defaults, Bellshaw brought up Drummond\u2019s letter to establish the hypocrisy of Google today. The letter declared that problems with a default setting are made worse by how changes to defaults are handled, and that most end users \u201cdo not change defaults.\u201d\n\nThese are exactly the arguments that other search engine companies, like DuckDuckGo, Brave or Microsoft\u2019s Bing, make when they accuse Google of being anticompetitive by making deals with Apple and others. The DOJ doubled down on this, saying Google has become the monopoly it denounced years ago.\n\nWhat does it all mean?\n\nThe case is expected to continue for several weeks, bringing to a head one of the biggest fights in tech antitrust since the U.S. took Microsoft to trial in the 1990s.\n\nIf the judge rules against Google, the outcome could look a lot like the Microsoft deal, in which the computer company was required to change its behavior and share its APIs with third-party developers. Microsoft was also banned from making anticompetitive and exclusive deals with computer manufacturers.\n\nGoogle might end up having to turn over all or most of the data it has collected to other search engines so they can improve their products and attract more users. The DOJ has said that Google gets 16 times more data than Bing does everyday.\n\nThe Google outcome could also have a ripple effect on other Big Tech cases. The FTC sued Amazon in September for using anticompetitive and unfair strategies to illegally maintain its monopoly power. The DOJ has been investigating Apple for years over the company\u2019s policy for third-party apps on its devices and whether it unfairly favors its own products. There\u2019s an ongoing case between the FTC and Facebook, wherein the agency calls on Facebook to sell Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nEnforcers will want to show that antitrust law is still relevant and can successfully take on the biggest, most powerful companies in the world."

        "body": "Eddy Cue, in a dark suit, peered down at the monitor in front of him. The screens in the Washington, DC, courtroom had briefly malfunctioned and left witnesses with only binders, but now the tech was up and running \u2014 showing an image of three iPhones, each demonstrating a part of the phone\u2019s setup process. Cue squinted down at the screen.\n\n\u201cThe resolution on this is terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should get a Mac.\u201d That got some laughs in an otherwise staid and quiet courtroom. Judge Amit Mehta, presiding over the case, leaned into his microphone and responded, \u201cIf Apple would like to make a donation\u2026\u201d That got even bigger laughs. Then everybody got back down to business.\n\nCue was on the stand as a witness in US v. Google, the landmark antitrust trial over Google\u2019s search business. Cue is one of the highest-profile witnesses in the case so far, in part because the deal between Google and Apple \u2014 which makes Google the default search engine on all Apple devices and pays Apple billions of dollars a year \u2014 is central to the US Department of Justice\u2019s case against Google.\n\nCue had two messages: Apple believes in protecting its users\u2019 privacy, and it also believes in Google. Whether those two statements can be simultaneously true became the question of the day.\n\nApple is in court because of something called the Information Services Agreement, or ISA: a deal that makes Google\u2019s search engine the default on Apple\u2019s products. The ISA has been in place since 2002, but Cue was responsible for negotiating its current iteration with Google CEO Sundar Pichai in 2016. In testimony today, the Justice Department grilled Cue about the specifics of the deal.\n\nWhen the two sides renegotiated, Cue said on the stand, Apple wanted a higher percentage of the revenue Google made from Apple users it directed toward the search engine. Discussion of specific numbers was reserved for closed court sessions, but Cue wanted Apple to get a higher percentage, while Pichai wanted to keep the deal as it was. They eventually compromised on some other number we weren\u2019t told in court, and Google has been paying Apple that amount since.\n\n\u201cI always felt like it was in Google\u2019s best interest, and our best interest, to get a deal done.\u201d\n\nMeagan Bellshaw, a Justice Department lawyer, asked Cue if he would have walked away from the deal if the two sides couldn\u2019t agree on a revenue-share figure. Cue said he\u2019d never really considered that an option: \u201cI always felt like it was in Google\u2019s best interest, and our best interest, to get a deal done.\u201d Cue also argued that the deal was about more than economics and that Apple never seriously considered switching to another provider or building its own search product. \u201cCertainly there wasn\u2019t a valid alternative to Google at the time,\u201d Cue said. He said there still isn\u2019t one.\n\nThat question \u2014 whether Apple picked Google because it\u2019s the most lucrative choice or the best product \u2014 was a key part of Cue\u2019s testimony and, in fact, a key part of the DOJ\u2019s entire case against Google. The Justice Department is focused on the deals Google makes \u2014 with Apple but also with Samsung and Mozilla and many others \u2014 to ensure it is the default search engine on practically every platform.\n\nBellshaw asked Cue a number of questions about the iPhone setup process. Those three screenshots showed the Appearance screen that shows up when you first boot up your iPhone so you can pick font sizes; the location-tracking prompt that appears when you open Maps; and the App Tracking Transparency pop-up that tells you when an app wants to collect your data. Cue objected to all these things being considered part of setup, but Bellshaw\u2019s point was that Apple offers its users a choice about lots of things, big and small, and that search could be one of them.\n\n\u201cWe try to get people up and running as fast as possible.\u201d\n\nCue acknowledged that the ISA didn\u2019t allow Apple to offer users a choice of search engines during setup but also said he wouldn\u2019t want to do that anyway. \u201cWe try to get people up and running as fast as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cSetup is just critical stuff.\u201d Showing people a bunch of search engines they\u2019ve never heard of would just be a bad user experience, he argued; even Cue couldn\u2019t remember the names of some of the alternatives to Google. \u201cWe make Google be the default search engine,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we\u2019ve always thought it was the best. We pick the best one and let users easily change it.\u201d (\u201cEasily\u201d is a persistent point of contention in this trial \u2014 DuckDuckGo\u2019s CEO, who testified last week, claimed it takes \u201ctoo many steps\u201d to switch.)\n\nAs for the privacy pop-ups? This is where Bellshaw began to press on how exactly Apple decided Google had the best product. She asked Cue if Apple believes user privacy is important, to which he said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Then, she showed a series of emails and slides in which Cue and Apple railed against Google\u2019s privacy policies. Cue readily agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ve always thought we had better privacy than Google,\u201d he told Bellshaw. He said that one provision of the ISA with Google was that Google had to allow people to search without logging in and that Apple has done things in Safari and around its platforms to make it harder for Google or anyone else to track users.\n\nBellshaw never quite said it, but the DOJ\u2019s implication seemed to be that, essentially, Google is a privacy menace anathema to everything Apple believes is important to its users, but Apple gives it a central place in its platform because Google pays it so handsomely. Bellshaw asked Cue to review some of Apple\u2019s financial filings. Isn\u2019t it true that the ISA represents a significant portion of Apple\u2019s profits, she asked? Cue said that\u2019s not how Apple looks at it because it doesn\u2019t account for all the work Apple did to make its platform so appealing that an agreement like this could work as well as it does.\n\nLater, after a closed session in the courtroom and a break for lunch, Google lawyer John Schmidtlein led Cue through a history of the Google / Apple partnership, and a history of the Safari browser. Cue noted that Safari\u2019s combination of URL and search bar was a user interface innovation, and the seamless Google integration was part of what made it work. In early promotional materials for Safari, Schmidtlein pointed out, the Google integration was nearly always mentioned.\n\n\u201cBefore 2003,\u201d Cue said, \u201cthe way that you searched the web was you had to go in and you had to type in google.com in the URL field, or you could type in another URL. We came up with the idea that if you type anything in the URL field that\u2019s not a URL, it just goes to search.\u201d\n\nSchmidtlein\u2019s overall point was that Google helped Safari succeed not by forcing Apple\u2019s hand, but by being a great product that integrated seamlessly with Apple\u2019s own stuff. He referenced Apple\u2019s deals with Yahoo and Bing that make those services easy to find, and both men argued that switching search engines is so easy as to be a non-issue. Bellshaw briefly stepped up to rebut that notion, and that was it for Cue\u2019s testimony.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s all the testimony we saw. Like so many things in this trial, the star witness was kept mostly under wraps thanks to complaints and worries about revealing confidential numbers and corporate secrets. But the questions put to Cue were the same ones the DOJ is going to keep asking: is Google really the best search engine, or is it just the one writing the biggest checks? And if those checks went away, what would the search engine market look like? Cue said Apple\u2019s never really thought about it. Google said Apple would be silly to do so. And the Justice Department thinks it\u2019s about time Apple starts doing so."

        "body": "A new class action lawsuit filed this week in the U.S. District Court in D.C. accuses Google and parent company Alphabet of anticompetitive behavior in violation of U.S. antitrust law, the Sherman Act, and others, on behalf of news publishers. The case, filed by Arkansas-based publisher Helena World Chronicle, argues that Google \u201csiphons off\u201d news publishers\u2019 content, their readers and ad revenue through anticompetitive means. It also specifically cites new AI technologies like Google\u2019s Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Bard AI chatbot as worsening the problem.\n\nIn the complaint, Helena World Chronicle, which owns and publishes two weekly newspapers in Arkansas, argues that Google is \u201cstarving the free press\u201d by sharing publishers\u2019 content on Google, losing them \u201cbillions of dollars.\u201d\n\nIn addition to new AI technologies, the suit points to Google\u2019s older question-and-answer technologies, like the \u201cKnowledge Graph\u201d launched in May 2012, as part of the problem.\n\n\u201cWhen a user searches for information on a topic, Google displays a \u2018Knowledge Panel\u2019 to the right of the search results. This panel contains a summary of content drawn from the Knowledge Graph database,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cGoogle compiled this massive database by extracting information from Publishers\u2019 websites \u2014 what Google calls \u2018materials shared across the web\u2019 \u2014and from \u2018open source and licensed databases,'\u201d it says.\n\nBy 2020, the Knowledge Graph had grown to 500 billion facts about 5 billion entities. But much of the \u201ccollective intelligence\u201d that Google tapped into was content \u201cmisappropriated from Publishers,\u201d the complaint alleges.\n\nOther Google technologies, like \u201cFeatured Snippets\u201d where Google algorithmically extracts answers from webpages, were also cited as shifting traffic away from publishers\u2019 websites.\n\nMore importantly, perhaps, is the suit\u2019s tackling of how AI will impact publishers\u2019 businesses. The problem was recently detailed in a report on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, which led with a shocking statistic. When online magazine The Atlantic modeled what would happen if Google integrated AI into search, it found that 75% of the time the AI would answer the user\u2019s query without requiring a click-through to its website, losing it traffic. This could have a major impact on publishers\u2019 traffic going forward, as Google today drives nearly 40% of their traffic, according to data from Similarweb.\n\nSome publishers are now trying to get ahead of the problem. For example, Axel Springer just this week inked a deal with OpenAI to license its news for AI model training. But overall, publishers believe they\u2019ll lose somewhere between 20-40% of their website traffic when Google\u2019s AI products fully roll out, The WSJ\u2019s report noted.\n\nThe lawsuit reiterates this concern, claiming that Google\u2019s recent advances in AI-based search were implemented with \u201cthe goal of discouraging end-users from visiting the websites of Class members who are part of the digital news and publishing line of commerce.\u201d\n\nSGE, it argues, offers web searchers a way to seek information in a conversational mode, but ultimately keeps users in Google\u2019s \u201cwalled garden\u201d as it \u201cplagiarizes\u201d their content. Publishers also can\u2019t block SGE because it uses the same web crawler as Google\u2019s general search service, GoogleBot.\n\nPlus, it says Google\u2019s Bard AI was trained on a dataset that included \u201cnews, magazine and digital publications,\u201d citing both a 2023 report from the News Media Alliance and a Washington Post article about AI training data for reference. (The Post, which worked with researchers at the Allen Institute for AI, had found that News and Media sites were the third largest category of AI training data.)\n\nThe case points to other concerns, too, like changing AdSense rates and evidence of improper spoliation of evidence on Google\u2019s part, by its destruction of chat messages \u2014 an issue raised in the recent Epic Games lawsuit against Google over app store antitrust issues, which Epic won.\n\nIn addition to damages, the suit is asking for an injunction that would require Google to obtain consent from publishers to use their website data to train its general artificial intelligence products including Google\u2019s own and those of rivals. It also asks Google to allow publishers who opt out of SGE to still show up in Google search results, among other things.\n\nThe U.S. lawsuit follows an agreement Google reached last month with the Canadian government which would see the search giant paying Canadian media for use of their content. Under the terms of the deal, Google will provide $73.5 million (100 million Canadian dollars) every year to news organizations in the country, with funds distributed based on the news outlets\u2019 headcount. Negotiations with Meta are still unresolved, though Meta began blocking news in Canada in August, in light of the pressure to pay for the content under the new Canadian law.\n\nThe case also arrives alongside the filing of the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit against Google for monopolizing digital ad technologies, and references the 2020 Justice Department\u2019s civil antitrust suit over search and search advertising (which are different markets from digital ad technologies in the more recent suit).\n\n\u201cThe anticompetitive effects of Google\u2019s scheme cause profound harm to competition, to consumers, to labor, and to a democratic free press,\u201d reads an announcement posted to the website of the law firm handling the case, Hausfeld.\n\n\u201cPlaintiff Helena World Chronicle, LLC invokes the Sherman Act and Clayton Act to seek class-wide monetary and injunctive relief to restore and ensure competition for digital news and reference publishing and set up guardrails to preserve a free marketplace of ideas in the new era of artificial intelligence,\u201d it states.\n\nA Google spokesperson offered a statement on the lawsuit, saying \u201cThis lawsuit is meritless. People have many ways to access information and news content today \u2013 through publishers\u2019 websites, dedicated apps, social media platforms, print papers and more. Google links people to publishers\u2019 websites more than 24 billion times each month \u2013 at no cost to them.\u201d\n\nThe complaint is available below.\n\nHelena World Chronicle, LLC v. Google LLC and Alphabet Inc by TechCrunch on Scribd\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This post was updated after publication with a statement provided by Google on Friday evening."

        "body": "The second of Sinner\u2019s Djokovic victories came in Italy\u2019s impressive Davis Cup semi-final triumph over Serbia, after saving three consecutive match points on serve, before besting the world No.1 again in the doubles. World No.4 Sinner, coached by Australia\u2019s Darren Cahill, is the first player to topple Djokovic twice in the same season since Russia\u2019s Daniil Medvedev in 2019. Italian teammates Lorenzo Sonego and Jannik Sinner will face Australia in the Davis Cup final. Credit: Getty However, if Popyrin can get the job done in the No.2 singles then Australia will, at minimum, reach the doubles with a live chance, and a good one, with 2022 Wimbledon champions Max Purcell and Matt Ebden to be unleashed. The query is whether Italian captain Filippo Volandri will turn to Lorenzo Musetti, who battled a leg issue at the end of his three-set loss to Serbia\u2019s Miomir Kecmanovic, or one of Lorenzo Sonego or Matteo Arnaldi.\n\nPopyrin won his only ATP Tour clash with Musetti \u2013 who has been as high as No.15 in the world \u2013 in a tight two-setter at last year\u2019s Miami Masters, but the emerging Italian claimed three of their four showdowns at the next level down. He is yet to play against Sonego, who Arthurs expects to play. \u201cI\u2019m assuming they will back in Popyrin because he played pretty well a couple of nights ago, and with his firepower \u2013 he\u2019s probably the key to the tie,\u201d Arthurs said. \u201cHe\u2019s showing all the signs of becoming a top-25 player in the next couple of years. His junior career suggested he was going to be a very good player, and it\u2019s unusual for someone to win the junior French Open and not go on to something big. Alexei Popyrin celebrates with Australian captain Lleyton Hewitt after his Davis Cup win. Credit: Getty Images \u201cThese moments can be a big springboard for someone like Alexei. He\u2019s a confidence player, and this is a very big moment \u2013 whoever he plays, Musetti or Sonego. But he\u2019s got to go out and embrace the moment, and he\u2019s the type of player who will enjoy it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to give de Minaur a chance with his fighting abilities, but the way Sinner has played the last six months, you\u2019d have to say Sinner is the favourite.\u201d Loading Hewitt animatedly embraced Popyrin after his straight-sets victory over 171st-ranked Finn Otto Virtanen, but Australia\u2019s Davis Cup captain would be even more thrilled if he could repeat the dose against Italy. Australia could also turn to an alternative No.2 singles option, with Jordan Thompson and Purcell waiting in the wings. \u201cIt\u2019s everybody\u2019s dream to play for their country,\u201d Popyrin said. \u201cI looked up to Lleyton, looked up to all the older Aussie legends. To be able to put on the green and gold, to be able to go out there and play for your country, no matter the format, if it\u2019s this Davis Cup or the old Davis Cup, you give your all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nerves, it\u2019s pressure \u2013 you\u2019re playing for everybody back home. It\u2019s something that nothing will ever compare to ... it really was the biggest moment of my career to get the first live rubber win, to get one foot into the final. It was something that I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d Loading Australia, who lost last year\u2019s final to Canada, has enjoyed a soft run on paper to this year\u2019s decider, eliminating the Czech Republic and Finland \u2013 with neither country boasting a top-30 singles player \u2013 but will have earned their 29th Davis Cup title if they account for Italy. Canada defeated Italy in the Davis Cup round-robin matches in September, but bowed out to Finland in the knockout stage without Felix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov, who have both battled injury and form. The final is due to start at 2am AEDT on Monday and will be broadcast on 9GEM.\n\nSinner ends Djoker\u2019s Davis Cup dream Novak Djokovic\u2019s dream of capping his great season by blasting Serbia past Australia in the Davis Cup final was blown up by Jannik Sinner\u2019s extraordinary double triumph over the world No.1. Instead, in the Davis Cup final in Malaga, Australia will face an Italy team running hot on the heroics of their golden boy Sinner, who beat Djokovic in both the singles and the doubles in the space of five exhilarating hours in their semi-final on Saturday (Sunday AEDT). Jannik Sinner saved three match points before going on to beat Novak Djokovic. Credit: Getty Images In one of the great Davis Cup rubbers, Djokovic had held three match points against Sinner and was on the verge of a completing a relatively workaday 2-0 victory for the Serbs.\n\nBut for only the fourth time in his unparalleled career, Djokovic was beaten from match-point up as Sinner roared back to complete his second victory over the master in just 12 days, winning 6-2, 2-6, 7-5. The 22-year-old Sinner, by now an irresistible force, then re-emerged to team up with Lorenzo Sonego and spray massive forehand winners around liberally as they outplayed a by now weary-looking Djokovic and Miomir Kecmanovic 6-3, 6-4. Djokovic had three match points in the singles rubber. Credit: Getty Images It was a crushing end to Djokovic\u2019s hopes of ending his triumphant season, which has featured three grand slam victories and an ATP finals showdown victory over Sinner just six days ago, with a second Davis Cup title. After telling fans to \u201cshut up\u201d earlier in the week, he again got irritated with the crowd in the doubles, pretending to be the conductor to the Italian fans\u2019 deafening chorus, but though he may be the greatest player who ever picked up a racquet, doubles looks an alien game to him.\n\nHis serve was broken in the first set and his court positioning left a big hole for Sinner to blast his forehand through the world No.1 and Kecmanovic, who had earlier worn down Lorenzo Musetti 6-7 (7-9), 6-2, 6-1 in the tie\u2019s opening singles. The tie, though, will forever be remembered for Sinner\u2019s comeback triumph in their third brilliant singles duel in less than a fortnight. This time, the Sinner of the Turin group stages re-emerged, the young titan reprising his victory of 12 days ago when he became the only man since Djokovic\u2019s Wimbledon final loss to Carlos Alcaraz to defeat the 24-time grand slam champion. Here he did something even more astonishing when, after soaking up immense pressure throughout the deciding set, he stared at 0-40 on his serve at 4-5. Yet the 22-year-old proved absolutely nerveless, firing down an ace to save the third of the three match points, and then immediately turning the tables by breaking Djokovic in the very next game amid wild Italian celebrations in the stands at the Palacio de deportes Martin Carpena.\n\nSinner then served out for a famous win, ending Djokovic\u2019s cherished unbeaten 21-singles winning streak in the Davis Cup and becoming the first man since 2019 to beat the Serb in singles twice in the same year. The drama between the two rivals wasn\u2019t over, as the two teams inevitably both drafted in their top singles players into the doubles decider. Sinner was again magnificent and still looking ominously fresh after more than four hours on court, with Djokovic\u2019s weak backhand into the net off the Italian\u2019s second serve in the doubles on match point seeming to sum up his disappointment. The beneficiaries of all this? Lleyton Hewitt\u2019s Australian side, who were happily enjoying a day\u2019s rest at their team hotel further down the Costa del Sol, watching the drama unfold on TV.\n\nWhile the Italy tie didn\u2019t finish until 8.15pm after a noon start, Alex de Minaur and co should be fresh for combat in Sunday afternoon\u2019s (Monday AEDT) final as they seek to lift the Davis Cup for the first time in 20 years. AAP De Minaur, Popyrin power Australia into Davis Cup final Lleyton Hewitt has declared his close-knit tennis band of brothers will give it \u201ca hell of a shake\u201d to bring back the Davis Cup to Australia after they roared into another final in Malaga. Following their 2-0 victory over Finland in Friday\u2019s semi-final, executed superbly without a dropped set in singles wins for Alexei Popyrin and Alex de Minaur, team captain Hewitt said he couldn\u2019t be prouder of their achievement in making back-to-back finals.\n\nAnd even though they\u2019ll be facing either a Serbian side led by world No.1 Novak Djokovic or an Italian team inspired by young superstar Jannik Sinner in Sunday\u2019s (Monday AEDT) final, the inspirational de Minaur was adamant: \u201cNo one really wants to play us.\u201d He delivered once more for Australia, taking an 11th victory in his last 13 cup singles matches, sealing Friday\u2019s (Saturday AEDT) win by defeating Emil Ruusuvuori 6-4, 6-3. Alex de Minaur stretches to return the ball against Finland\u2019s Emil Ruusuvuori. Credit: AP It had followed a superb win from teammate Popyrin, who defied jangling nerves to earn a 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 victory over Otto Virtanen. It meant the Australians\u2019 crack doubles team of Max Purcell and Matt Ebden weren\u2019t even needed.\n\nIt will be Australia\u2019s 49th appearance in the Davis Cup final, as they seek the trophy for the 29th t28-time champions Australia, in a 49th final, seek a first win in the World Cup of men\u2019s tennis in 20 years. \u201cWe\u2019re a very solid squad, a lot of depth in every single position, and if we can get ourselves to a deciding doubles, we\u2019ve got an unbelievable pairing as well,\u201d de Minaur said. \u201cSo we singles guys have just got do our best to try and get a win and let the doubles guys do the job. \u201cHopefully we can go one better this year,\u201d he added, recalling the 2-0 defeat by Canada in 2022. De Minaur had been the hero on Wednesday, pulling out an extraordinary comeback win over Jiri Lehecka with Australia on the verge of defeat in their quarter-final with the Czech Republic.\n\nBut he was happy to pass the laurels to Popyrin, a late squad replacement who\u2019d been asked to take on the troublesome \u201csecond singles\u201d role by Hewitt. Loading \u201cAlexei hasn\u2019t played for Australia in a very long time [two years], had a massive match today against a very high-quality opponent and dug super deep,\u201d said de Minaur. Popyrin managed to deliver a rock solid game, making only 11 unforced errors to his erratic opponent\u2019s 25, to prevail in just under an hour-and-a-half. \u201cIt was probably the biggest win of my career,\u201d he admitted. \u201cTo win a match that means so much to us, it\u2019s an honour and something I\u2019ll never forget. Nothing compares to this.\n\n\u201cI thought I was ready but when I came out and heard the two sets of fans chanting so hard, but it was nerves that I\u2019ve never experienced before.\u201d Loading It wasn\u2019t easy. The pressure was on with Thanasi Kokkinakis, the injured teammate he\u2019d replaced, Purcell and Jordan Thompson having all lost opening singles ties in this year\u2019s competition, and Popyrin struggled too against a big-hitting 22-year-old going for broke. But after repelling a set point in the opening stanza, Popyrin\u2019s solidity in comparison to his increasingly erratic opponent helped silence a noisy contingent of Finnish fans, who\u2019d been hoping to cheer their underdogs to a first-ever final. De Minaur, cheered on by his excited mum, then didn\u2019t need similar heroics to Wednesday\u2019s as he overcame the loss of the first two games."

        "body": "The 2019 Rugby World Cup final between England and South Africa was one of many firsts: the game itself capped off a sensational tournament played outside of the sport's traditional strongholds for the first time; it was the first final in which South Africa scored a try, and by full-time, the 32-12 score in the Springboks' favour sealed a record-equalling third title for the Rainbow Nation.\n\nFast forward four years, and South Africa once again prepare to take on England in an all-or-nothing match to decide which nation gets a shot at World Cup glory \u2014 but this time around, the pair meet in the semi-finals of the 2023 tournament, rather than the decider.\n\nThat won't make an ounce of difference for either camp, though, as these two long-time rivals prepare for a battle that could re-define the definition of a 'physical encounter.'\n\nThe #Springboks are gearing up for another tough challenge this week with a semi-final clash against England \ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc65\udb40\udc6e\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc7f#StrongerTogether #RWC2023 pic.twitter.com/HLSnnjWggB \u2014 Springboks (@Springboks) October 18, 2023\n\nEngland are the only side still competing who are yet to lose a game, and that will stand them in good stead coming into this semi-final. Dominant wins over Argentina, Japan and Chile sealed passage to the last eight, and after being given an almighty scare by Samoa in their final pool match, England overcame a Fijian fightback in Marseille to triumph 30-24. Despite being outscored by three tries to two, captain Owen Farrell kicked 20 points, sending his side into the last four at the expense of 2023's breakout stars.\n\nThe Springboks have done it tough, too, having already faced two of the tournament favourites on their way to the semi-finals. Comfortable defeats of Scotland, Romania and Tonga couldn't mask the disappointment of the 13-8 loss to Ireland, which consigned South Africa to second in Pool B. However, with Ireland sent home by the All Blacks in the quarters, the Bokke showed their World Cup mettle to edge the hosts 29-28 at the Stade de France, sneaking past Les Bleus in one of the best games of rugby you're ever likely to see.\n\nThe last time Cheslin Kolbe played England at a Rugby World Cup... \ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6 \ud83c\udfc6#RWC2023 | #ENGvRSA pic.twitter.com/Riw2uaSaKa \u2014 Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) October 19, 2023\n\nBoth sides' journeys have seen twists, turns, and bumps in the road, but it's led them both to within 80 minutes of a Rugby World Cup final. England will no doubt be looking to echo the spirit of 2019, when they beat the All Blacks 19-7 to reach the final, but in South Africa, they face a side who have taken their game to new heights just to reach the semis.\n\nMORE: 2023 Rugby World Cup final: Details, kick-off time and every team's route\n\nWhat time does England vs South Africa kick off?\n\nEngland and South Africa face off in the 2023 Rugby World Cup's second semi-final, played at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, France.

The high-ball security and hulking frame of Freddie Steward returns to the No. 15 jersey in one of three changes, while at inside centre, Manu Tuilagi starts hoping to repeat his heroics of four years ago, when his early try in a dominant semi-final performance took England past the All Blacks.\n\nEngland's other two changes come in the tight five, with Steve Borthwick making some big calls ahead of this game. Joe Marler starts ahead of vice-captain Ellis Genge at loosehead prop, and Ollie Chessum is replaced in the second-row by George Martin. The latter is winning only his seventh England cap but gets the starting nod alongside Maro Itoje, with Genge, Chessum and the rest of the replacements hoping to make an impact sizeable enough to overcome the Springboks' infamous 'bomb squad'.\n\nTheir time is now \ud83d\ude4c\n\n\n\nHere is the @EnglandRugby team to take on reigning champions South Africa in the semi-final in Paris#RWC2023 | #ENGvRSA pic.twitter.com/nkf6rXBPUU \u2014 Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) October 19, 2023\n\nEngland starting XV: Freddie Steward, Jonny May, Joe Marchant, Manu Tuilagi, Elliot Daly, Owen Farrell, Alex Mitchell; Joe Marler, Jamie George, Dan Cole, Maro Itoje, George Martin, Courtney Lawes, Tom Curry, Ben Earl.\n\nEngland replacements: Theo Dan, Ellis Genge, Kyle Sinckler, Ollie Chessum, Billy Vunipola, Danny Care, George Ford, Ollie Lawrence.\n\nThe Springboks are unchanged from that epic quarter-final with France, having all played their part as Jacques Nienaber's side hung on in the second half. The contribution of backs Kurt-Lee Arendse, Damian de Allende and Cheslin Kolbe saw all three cross for first-half tries, with Kolbe's coming off the back of a charged-down conversion from France's Thomas Ramos. Preventing those two points proved crucial in the end.\n\nThe key contribution, though, came from Eben Etzebeth, who bulldozed his way over to score the only five-pointer of the second half and wrestle the game back into South African hands. He and Franco Mostert pack down together in the second row, while hooker Bongi Mbonambi, utility Deon Fourie, veteran Duane Vermeulen and the devilish Kwagga Smith will all be looking to back up superb quarter-final performances to take the Springboks to a second consecutive World Cup final.\n\nSouth Africa starting XV: Damian Willemse, Kurt-Lee Arendse, Jesse Kriel, Damian de Allende, Cheslin Kolbe, Manie Libbok, Cobus Reinach; Steven Kitshoff, Bongi Mbonambi, Frans Malherbe, Eben Etzebeth, Franco Mostert, Siya Kolisi, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Duane Vermeulen.\n\nSouth Africa replacements: Deon Fourie, Ox Nche, Vincent Koch, RG Snyman, Kwagga Smith, Faf de Klerk, Handre Pollard, Willie le Roux.\n\nEngland vs. South Africa betting odds, prediction\n\nThe last time these two sides met was a tumultuous period to say the least, particularly for English rugby. South Africa's dominant 27-13 victory at Twickenham proved to be the last game in charge for Eddie Jones, the coach who had taken England to the 2019 World Cup final. In his place, Steve Borthwick was hired, and he's just one game away from repeating that feat.\n\nEngland's form at this tournament has been perfect \u2014 at face value. Argentina, Japan, Chile, Samoa and Fiji have all provided highlights \u2014 Los Pumas are also in the semi-finals \u2014 and England have beaten all of them. However, only Japan and Chile were defeated with bonus points, and the narrow wins over both Samoa and Fiji in their last two games showed that England are certainly gettable.\n\nIn short, this semi-final requires a huge step up in quality for Borthwick's side, and that's why we think that the Springboks will be victorious at the Stade de France. South Africa have already shown they can match, and beat, the world's best, and we think that they'll do the latter in Saint-Denis."

Subscribe for free.\n\nWelcome back to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.\n\nIt was an absolutely wild week on the robotaxi front, and more specifically for GM\u2019s self-driving car subsidiary Cruise.\n\nThe week started off with the California Department of Motor Vehicles suspending Cruise\u2019s driverless and deployment permits (with the California Public Utilities Commission following shortly after), effectively ending the company\u2019s robotaxi operations in San Francisco just months after receiving the last necessary permit to commercialize its operations.\n\nTwo days later, Cruise decided to pause driverless operations in every market it had started to charge for its robotaxi service, including Austin, Houston and Phoenix.\n\nThat decision was surprising to me based on how sources had described an all-hands meeting earlier in the week that was led by co-founder and CEO Kyle Vogt. In that meeting, which came the day after the DMV suspended Cruise\u2019s permit, Vogt and other leaders told staff the company had not paused operations elsewhere besides California and gave no indication that the company was planning to. Instead, Vogt told employees the company was re-evaluating how it discloses information to regulators to ensure it is clearly communicated, according to an account from sources who heard the call.\n\nCruise had even quietly launched driverless operations in Miami (just a few vehicles), a move that suggested the company was moving ahead despite its significant problems in California.\n\nWhat changed? Perhaps Cruise execs were pressured by GM or they looked around and realized that they were losing support from other states. Either way, Cruise said it\u2019s now going to examine \u201cprocesses, systems, and tools and reflect on how we can better operate in a way that will earn public trust.\u201d\n\nThat might be a hefty challenge, especially in California. As the Cruise drama unfolded, opposition against robotaxis grew in cities like Los Angeles. And two of the biggest groups to oppose robotaxi expansion in California are now formally working together.\n\nWant to reach out with a tip, comment or complaint?

The tiny car in question? Project X, a concept built by the Foxconn-led Mobility in Harmony Consortium (MIH). The cute little EV is a three-seater; the spot in the backseat where you\u2019d normally seat a fourth person is taken up by two Gogoro battery pack slots.\n\nAt the event, MIH said it aims to sell 100,000 of the minicars per year in India, Thailand and Japan starting in 2025. The company will initially target fleet operators and ride-hailing services rather than individual customers. MIH says Project X supports autonomous driving Levels 2 to 4 depending on the user\u2019s needs. The price isn\u2019t yet fixed, but should top around $20,000.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if Gogoro\u2019s swappable batteries will be used to power the vehicles going forward. After all, that would require Gogoro to set up a swapping network in those regions. But if so, it would signal a new revenue stream for the company, which has been struggling to reach profitability amid softening demand and large investments into international expansion.\n\n\u2014 Rebecca Bellan\n\nDeal of the week\n\nWell this is a fun one.\n\nFlexport is in talks to acquire the technology of Convoy, the once buzzy digital freight startup that abruptly shuttered after failing to find a buyer. This possible deal, which was reported by WSJ, didn\u2019t have any other details, but it still made me raise an eyebrow.\n\nLest you forget, Flexport founder Ryan Petersen just took back the CEO title after his hand-picked successor was pushed out. Petersen\u2019s big message has been getting the company\u2019s financial house back in order and has criticized former CEO Dave Clark of overspending, specifically around hiring and expanding too quickly. Petersen has spent the past month cutting costs, including laying off about 20% of its workers, or about 600 people.\n\nIf Flexport acquires the technology, the company plans to restore Convoy\u2019s trucking services for as many customers and partners as possible, according to WSJ\u2019s source. And folks, that\u2019s going to cost money. Is Petersen\u2019s reign of financial frugality already over?\n\nOther deals that got my attention \u2026\n\nFaction, the driverless tech developer, raised an undisclosed amount in a round led by TDK Ventures. Ducera Partners, Trucks Venture Capital and Fifty Years also joined the round.\n\nOla Electric raised $384.4 million in a funding round, which included about $240 million in debt. Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund Temasek led the funding round and Indian government-backed lender State Bank of India bankrolled the debt. The new round values the Bengaluru-headquartered electric vehicle startup at about $5.4 billion\n\nPony.ai, the Chinese autonomous vehicle startup, scored $100 million from Neom, Saudi Arabia\u2019s futuristic city and development project. As part of the deal, a joint venture will be established to develop, manufacture and deploy autonomous vehicles and smart infrastructure in Neom and key markets in the Middle East North Africa region.\n\nNeom also announced plans this week to set up a $10 billion joint venture with Danish freight forwarder DSV.\n\nStellantis made a \u20ac1.5 billion deal ($1.59 billion) to take a 20% stake in Chinese electric vehicle maker Zhejiang Leapmotor Technologies, just days after ending manufacturing in the country. The deal includes the formation of Leapmotor International, a 51% to 49% Stellantis-led joint venture that has exclusive rights for the export and sale, as well as manufacturing, of Leapmotor products outside China.\n\nNotable reads and other tidbits\n\nAutonomous vehicles\n\nWaymo driverless vehicles are now available through the Uber app, starting with Phoenix. The launch comes five months since the two companies announced a multi-year agreement for the autonomous vehicle service to be accessed via the Uber app.\n\nElectric vehicles, batteries & charging\n\nFord is delaying about $12 billion in planned investments on EVs, including construction of a second battery plant with joint venture partner SK On due to softening demand for higher-priced premium electric vehicles. While EV sales have grown, consumers aren\u2019t willing to pay a premium for an EV over a gas or hybrid vehicle. That price pressure has squeezed profits, and in the case of Ford\u2019s EV business caused losses to grow.\n\nGeneral Motors and long-time partner Honda have ended plans to build millions of affordable and smaller electric vehicles as the automakers come to terms with high interest rates and battery costs coupled with softening EV demand. Anyone spotting a trend here?\n\nNikola, the electric and hydrogen-powered heavy truck maker, was awarded $165 million from its founder and former executive chairman, Trevor Milton, in an arbitration proceeding.\n\nNio has opened its 2,000th Power Swap Station in China, nearing its goal to build 2,300 stations by the end of 2023. The company has expanded on its strategy of swapping out EV batteries, rather than charging them, an infrastructure-intensive process that has the potential to make topping up a battery as quick as filling up a gas tank.\n\nTesla has the attention of the U.S. Department of Justice \u2014 again. This time it has received requests for information, including subpoenas from the DOJ related to perks, the advertised range of its EVs and personnel decisions.\n\nIn-car and mobile tech\n\nGoogle Maps and Waze stopped live traffic updates in Israel and the Gaza Strip at the request of the Israel Defense Forces. A Google spokesperson said the ability to see live traffic conditions and business information was halted temporarily out of \u201cconsideration for the safety of local communities.\u201d Google did something similar in 2022 amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine because the apps were being used to track military movements.\n\nXPeng, often called the Chinese challenger to Tesla, has removed high-definition mapping in its XNGP assisted driving feature following its rival\u2019s lead.\n\nRide-hailing and car-sharing\n\nRapido, the eight-year-old Indian bike taxi startup, is expanding into the cab market in the South Asian nation, where Uber and its homegrown competitor Ola dominate.\n\nPeer-to-peer car-sharing marketplace Turo has introduced a buy-now-pay-later option. Now you can reserve a car without immediately paying for it until seven days before a trip. Turo says it built the BNPL option in-house.\n\nUAW strike\n\nProgress was made as the United Autoworkers strike wrapped up its sixth week. The UAW struck tentative deals with Ford and Stellantis this past week. Workers still have to ratify the deal, but with UAW president Shawn Fain\u2019s support that outcome is likely.\n\nHowever, over at GM, it appears that negotiations are moving in the opposite direction. The UAW called for a surprise walkout at GM\u2019s Spring Hill, Tennessee factory, a plant where 4,000 workers assemble engines and three Cadillac models."

When season five arrived last year, there were calls for the show to include a \u201cfictional explainer\u201d \u2013 something Netflix did not do.\n\nWith the show heading into the late Nineties and early Noughties in its final season, which arrived on Netflix on Thursday (16 November), events are being depicted on screen that many of the public will remember well.\n\nThe first part of season six takes place in the summer of 1997, and sees Prince Charles (Dominic West) building on his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles (Olivia Williams), while Princess Diana (Elizabeth Debicki) sparks up a romance with film producer Dodi Fayed (Khalid Abdalla). The show also features the pair\u2019s death in a car crash in Paris.\n\nAs the new season arrives, and fans wonder what in The Crown is based in reality, here\u2019s everything you need to know.\n\nDiana\u2019s role with Tony Blair\u2019s government\n\nEpisode one sees Diana visiting Tony (Bertie Carvel) and Cherie Blair (Lydia Leonard) with William after asking for a meeting with him. Recalling their discussion to the Queen, Blair says that Diana feels she \u201cstill has a lot to offer the country as a public servant\u201d. He says that she had asked if there was a way to work with the government on \u201ca more formal basis\u201d and that any \u201cofficial role\u201d would be appreciated.\n\nBertie Carvel as Blair (Netflix)\n\nFollowing Diana\u2019s death, Downing Street confirmed that Diana had visited Blair at Chequers with her son a few weeks before, where they discussed a special role for her as an overseas \u201cambassador\u201d for Britain. Diana told a journalist at the time that the prime minister had recognised her skills and asked her to undertake \u201cmissions\u201d abroad for Britain.\n\nQueen Elizabeth\u2019s reluctance to accept Camilla\n\nAs The Crown season six begins, Charles is frustrated at the public for demonising Camilla long after his split from Diana. Asks the Queen if she\u2019d received the invitation to Camilla\u2019s 50th birthday, to which she says she has, but cannot attend as she\u2019s in Derbyshire. When Charles points out that plans \u201ccan always be changed\u201d, she replies: \u201cWhy would we want to change it?\u201d She doesn\u2019t attend, but later tells Prince Philip that she doesn\u2019t want for Camilla to be considered \u201cwicked, because she\u2019s not\u201d or to be unkind to her.\n\nCharles (West) hosts Camilla\u2019s (Williams) birthday (Netflix)\n\nIt took a while for Queen Elizabeth and Camilla to grow close. According to historian Robert Lacey, she was reluctant to accept Charles\u2019s request to be more accommodating to Camilla. Unlike in The Crown, she is said to have once referred to Camilla as \u201cthat wicked woman\u201d to Charles\u2019s face. However, she grew to become closer to Camilla. Despite announcing in 2005 that Camilla would become the Princess Consort rather than Queen Consort, it was announced that Camilla would be queen seven months before Elizabeth\u2019s death.\n\nAccess unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up\n\nAccess unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up\n\nDodi Fayed\u2019s engagement to an American model\n\nWhen viewers first meet Dodi in The Crown, he\u2019s in Paris with a woman with short, blonde hair. However, it\u2019s not Diana, but an American woman who he says he\u2019s picking out fabric for a Malibu home with and says he\u2019s marrying in three weeks. His father Mohamed is unimpressed, calling him to Saint Tropez to meet a \u201cspecial guest\u201d and leave his \u201cgold-digger\u201d fiance \u2013 who he also calls \u201cMadame Bikini\u201d \u2013 behind. The model later confronts Dodi, asking if he was with Diana when he leaves her to go see his father. Diana also alludes to a \u201clawsuit\u201d between Dodi and his ex.\n\nDiana (Debicki) and Dodi (Abdalla) (PA)\n\nThis storyline comes to close to the truth as told by model Kelly Fisher, who claimed to have been engaged to Dodi when he met Diana. Fisher had previously modelled for brands such as Victoria\u2019s Secret and magazines including Elle and Marie Claire. As in The Crown, Fisher \u2013 who met Fayed in July 1996 \u2013 was on another Fayed yacht when Dodi and Diana were first photographed. She staged a press conference where she announced that she was filing a breach-of-contract lawsuit against Dodi, after he allegedly asked her to stop modelling as much and prioritise the relationship. Through tears, she claimed that he had proposed to her (something his family denied) and promised to buy her a house in Malibu. However, she dropped the lawsuit following Dodi\u2019s death.\n\nDiana\u2019s close relationship with paparazzi on France yacht trip\n\nWhen Dodi and Diana first spend time together on his father\u2019s yacht in France, the paparazzi are never far away. However, when William refuses to go outside until the photographers leave them alone, she takes a boat out to visit them. Wearing a swimming costume, she asks them: \u201cWe\u2019re having a lovely time, apart from one little thing: you lot.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be like that, you love us really,\u201d they reply. Diana asks them to leave her alone as they\u2019re \u201cfreaking out\u201d her sons, before telling one photographer \u2013 who she knows by name \u2013 that if they go away, \u201cyou\u2019re going to get a big surprise with the next thing I do\u201d. She then poses for them in her swimsuit, but complains in a later episode that they can \u201cnever relax\u201d with the press \u201cconstantly\u201d around.\n\nDiana (Debicki) on the Fayed yacht (Daniel Escale/Netflix)\n\nFormer Vanity Fair editor Tina Brown, who wrote the controversial 2007 book Diana Chronicles, claimed that Diana would often tip off the press and \u201c couldn\u2019t resist giving them the images they wanted\u201d, including on the boat. Photographer Daniel Pirrie, who ended up selling the photo of the kiss, claimed that Diana herself invited him to photograph her on holiday with Dodi in France that summer. \u201cShe told me she\u2019d be on the yacht somewhere in the Mediterranean,\u201d he told The Daily Mail in 2013. \u201cShe let me know she was going to be on a tender going out to the yacht. I think overall, she was happy with all the pictures taken that summer\u2026 I knew that Diana had wanted [the kiss photo] to be taken.\u201d\n\nMohamed al Fayed\u2019s role in securing kiss photo\n\nThroughout season six, Mohamed al Fayed (Salim Daw) is shown as heavily invested in his son Dodi\u2019s relationship with Diana, even ringing up the maid to ask if they have been \u201cintimate\u201d. In Arabic, he then asks his secretary if they can find him an Arabic photographer \u2013 \u201cnot just any idiot with a long lens\u201d, but \u201cthe best photographer on the Meditarranean\u201d.\n\nSalim Daw as Mohamed al Fayed (Netflix)\n\nIt\u2019s not known whether Mohamed was so instrumental in securing the photo of Dodi and Diana kissing for the first time. However, following the Harrods owner\u2019s death this year, biographer Tom Bower recalled in The Times how Al-Fayed \u201cgleefully\u201d showed him the photographs of Dodi and Diana and allegedly \u201crevealed how he had rapidly bought a yacht suitable for his son\u2019s seduction of her\u201d.\n\nDodi\u2019s proposal to Diana on the night they died\n\nAfter bursting into tears going for dinner at the Ritz, move upstairs, he proposes to her with a ring she had previously pointed out when they sheltered from crowds in a Monte Carlo jewellery shop. She tells him to get up off his knee \u201cI know the whole world is wondering if we\u2019re going to get married, but that\u2019s not a reason to actually do it.\u201d However, they share a drink and bittersweet conversation about how they need to live their lives going forward - advice\n\nDodi is shown proposing to Diana before they died (Daniel Escale/Netflix)\n\nIn real life, Dodi did not propose to Diana on that fateful evening in Paris. However, at the inquest into the death in 2007, the jury were shown CCTV footage of him purchasing an engagement ring worth \u00a311,600 in a jewellers across the square from the Ritz on the afternoon of the crash. It was later believed to have been delivered to their room before they went to Dodi\u2019s flat, where a ring bearing the words \u201cDis-moi Oui\u201d (\u201cTell me Yes\u201d) \u2013 also the name of episode three \u2013 was later recovered, alongside a receipt for a \u201cbague de fian\u00e7aille\u201d (engagement ring). Speaking at the inquest, his father Mohamed claimed that the pair had met the jeweller in Monte Carlo during the holiday on the yacht, and that he believed Dodi planned to propose that night.\n\nPrince William goes missing in Balmoral after Diana\u2019s death\n\nAfter learning of Diana\u2019s death from his father at the royal residence of Balmoral in Scotland, William (Rufus Kampa) is left heartbroken with grief and angry at his family\u2019s response to it. At one point, Charles is informed that the prince is not in his room and that \u201cno one can find him\u201d, prompting Charles and Prince Harry to look for him and a subsequent hunt across the grounds for the young royal. He is not located, but later walks back to the house on his own accord, drenched in rain. \u201c14 hours, that poor boy was gone,\u201d the Queen later says.\n\nWilliam (Kampa) goes missing after his mother\u2019s death (Keith Bernstein)\n\nIt\u2019s true that William and Harry initially stayed in Balmoral with their grandmother following the death of Diana. While it\u2019s not known whether he went missing, during a visit to Scotland in 2021, William recalled how that experience was one of the \u201csaddest\u201d moments of his life. \u201cI was in Balmoral when I was told that my mother had died. Still in shock, I found sanctuary in the service at Crathie Kirk that very morning,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd in the dark days of grief that followed, I found comfort and solace in the Scottish outdoors. As a result, the connection I feel to Scotland will forever run deep.\u201d\n\nThe Crown season six part one is on Netflix now, with part two arriving on 14 December."

The latest installment takes place between the late 1990s to mid-2000s, and includes the lead-up to Princess Diana\u2019s fatal Paris car crash in 1997.\n\nThe season begins with Princess Diana (played by Elizabeth Debicki) whisking her sons - Prince William (played by Rufus Kampa) and Prince Harry (played by Fflyn Edwards) - away on summer holiday to Saint-Tropez, France. After staying several days on Mohamed Al Fayed\u2019s yacht, the boys return home to London where their father, the then-Prince of Wales, accompanies them to Balmoral Castle to vacation with the rest of the royal family in Scotland.\n\nIn episode three, Diana\u2019s partner Dodi Fayed (played by Khalid Abdalla) surprises her with a quick trip to Paris, France. However, the princess is keen to return home to the United Kingdom, and is eager to speak to her sons over the phone. A mob of paparazzi following the couple delays Diana\u2019s scheduled phone call with William and Harry, until she\u2019s able to catch them again later that evening.\n\nIt is in this scene that The Crown depicts the doting mother\u2019s final conversation with her sons.\n\nWilliam, then 15, and Harry, then 12, inquire over the phone when their mother will be coming back home from Paris. \u201cI\u2019m coming home tomorrow, and I\u2019m seeing you both tomorrow night,\u201d Diana replies in the episode, which also takes place on the same day as her fatal car crash later that evening. The boys then ask Diana whether she plans on marrying Dodi, considering their relationship has been plastered all over the tabloids.\n\nDiana\u2019s poignant last words to William and Harry shown in The Crown scene\n\n\u201cWell, you know better than to believe the papers,\u201d she tells William, before adding: \u201cI\u2019m emphatically not going to marry Dodi. To be honest, I can\u2019t wait to come home.\u201d\n\nWhen William sweetly asks his mother if she\u2019s doing \u201cokay\u201d, Diana candidly tells her eldest son: \u201cI\u2019m okay. It\u2019s just a bit mad here. I don\u2019t really understand how I ended up here. Mummy just needs to make some changes to her life, that\u2019s all. But that\u2019s not your problem, that\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\nBefore saying their goodbyes, Diana reminds William and Harry that she will be seeing them the next day - although that day never comes. \u201cI\u2019ll see you both tomorrow night,\u201d she says. \u201cJust the three of us.\u201d\n\nThe moment unsurprisingly tugged on the heartstrings of many viewers, who took to social media to share their thoughts on the devastating moment.\n\n\u201cThe last phone call between Harry, William and Diana broke my heart,\u201d one fan wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n\u201cThat precious phone call between Diana and her sons,\u201d said someone else. \u201cDon\u2019t mind me, I\u2019m just gonna cry in one corner.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last call between Harry, William and Diana is heartbreaking,\u201d a third user commented.\n\nIn both the series and in real-life, Diana and Dodi - along with their chauffeur, Henri Paul - were killed on 31 August 1997 when their Mercedes-Benz was pursued by paparazzi and crashed in the Pont de l\u2019Alma tunnel in Paris. The mother of two was 36 years old.\n\nThe fatal car crash was recreated in the very first scene of season six. While the incident is not shown on-screen, a car carrying Diana and Dodi is seen speeding past a man walking his dog, before entering the tunnel. As the vehicle\u2019s horn blares, he calls emergency services on his cell phone.\n\nAustralian actor Elizabeth Debicki, who took over the role of Diana from Emma Corrin in season five, admitted it was \u201cdifficult to recreate\u201d the scene - especially with her character being hounded by the paparazzi. \u201cIt was heavy and very manic, and incredibly invasive. And it had a kind of pressure to it,\u201d Debicki said in an interview with Netflix.\n\n\u201cAt times it\u2019s almost like an animalistic response to being pursued, by that many actors playing the press, because there\u2019s nowhere you can go and you only have to be in a situation like that for about a minute, before you realise this is completely unbearable.\u201d\n\nThe first four episodes of The Crown season six are available to stream on Netflix in the US and UK."

        "body": "European Union regulators have sent Amazon a formal statement of objections setting out competition concerns over its proposed acquisition of robot vacuum maker, iRobot.\n\nThe step does not confirm the EU will seek to block the deal but it shows antitrust regulators do remain concerned. It could therefore push Amazon to offer remedies to EU authorities to settle the investigation and avoid the risk of the acquisition being blocked.\n\nAmazon has already lowered its acquisition price for iRobot \u2014 which was originally an all-cash offer of $1.7 billion back in August 2022 \u2014 by 15% owing to increased debt taken on by its target while regulatory snags delayed closing the deal at the original purchase price.\n\nThe bloc has been closely scrutinizing the Amazon-iRobot deal since July when the EU announced its in-depth probe. The Commission said at the time it was worried the transaction would allow Amazon to restrict competition in the market for robot vacuum cleaners (RVCs) and strengthen its position as online marketplace provider in a number of ways.\n\nToday\u2019s announcement by the EU, following several months of in-depth examination looking at how the transaction might impact competition, lays out formal concerns for Amazon to respond to. The EU\u2019s objections focus on foreclosure risks.\n\nThe EU says its concerns focus on whether the deal will give Amazon the ability and incentive to foreclose iRobot\u2019s rivals by deploying strategies aimed at preventing competitors from selling RVCs on Amazon\u2019s marketplace and/or making it harder for them to do so \u2014 such as by delisting rival products; reducing their visibility in both non-paid (i.e. organic) and paid results (i.e. ads) displayed on its marketplace; limiting their access to certain widgets it operates (such as the \u201cother products you may like\u201d feature) or \u201ccertain commercially-attractive product labels\u201d (e.g. \u2018Amazon\u2019s choice\u2019 or \u2018Works With Alexa\u2019); and/or by directly or indirectly raising the costs of iRobot\u2019s rivals to advertise and sell their RVCs on its marketplace.\n\n\u201cAmazon may have the ability to foreclose iRobot\u2019s rivals because Amazon\u2019s online marketplace is a particularly important channel to sell RVCs in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain,\u201d the Commission writes in a press release. \u201cRVC customers in these countries particularly rely on Amazon both in terms of product discovery as well as for their final purchasing decision.\u201d\n\nThe Commission is also worried Amazon may have the incentive to foreclose iRobot\u2019s rivals because it may be economically profitable for it to do so. \u201cThe merged entity would likely gain more from additional sales of iRobot RVCs, than it would lose from fewer sales of iRobot\u2019s rivals and other related products on Amazon. Such gains include benefits from additional data gathered from iRobot\u2019s users,\u201d it suggests.\n\nWere Amazon to deploy such foreclosure strategies the Commission\u2019s view at this stage of the probe is it could restrict competition in the market for RVCs, leading to \u201chigher prices, lower quality, and less innovation for consumers\u201d.\n\nThe EU has reached this pass of laying out formal concerns after conducting what it describes as a \u201cwide-ranging investigation to understand the market and the potential impact of the deal\u201d, which it says included analysing internal documents provided by Amazon and iRobot and gathering views from market participants such as suppliers of RVCs and other smart home devices, as well as from providers of online sales channels.\n\nIt also says it closely cooperated with other competition authorities during both the initial investigation and the in-depth investigation, adding that it will continue to do so during the remainder of the in-depth investigation. Although the U.K.\u2019s competition authority already cleared the deal back in June.\n\nAmazon was contacted for a response to the EU\u2019s statement of objections. A company spokesperson sent us this statement in which it claims iRobot faces \u201cintense competition\u201d from other RVC suppliers:\n\nWe continue to work through the process with the European Commission and are focused on addressing its questions and any identified concerns at this stage. iRobot, which faces intense competition from other vacuum cleaner suppliers, offers practical and inventive products. We believe Amazon can offer a company like iRobot the resources to accelerate innovation and invest in critical features while lowering prices for consumers.\n\nLate last year the EU settled with Amazon over two earlier competition probes \u2014 one delving into antitrust concerns about Amazon\u2019s use of merchant data to bolster its own retail business; and a second one looking at how it operated the \u201cBuy Box\u201d and its Prime loyalty program.\n\nIn those cases Amazon agreed a series of commitments to end the probes \u2014 including saying it would stop using non-public data from its marketplace sellers and boost transparency for merchants; and pledging to treat all sellers equally, regardless of whether they pay for its logistics services.\n\nAt the time the EU\u2019s then competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, trumpeted the outcome as setting what she dubbed \u201cnew rules for how Amazon operates its business in Europe\u201d \u2014 arguing the settlement meant the ecommerce giant could \u201cno longer abuse its dual role\u201d as marketplace operator and own brand retailer; and further claiming the outcome would ensure \u201ccompeting independent retailers and carriers as well as consumers will benefit from these changes opening up new opportunities and choice.\u201d\n\nGiven the commitments the EU already extracted from Amazon after those earlier investigations it\u2019s interesting to see the bloc remains concerned over levers the ecommerce behemoth still has its disposal to potentially influence competitive outcomes on its marketplace vis-\u00e0-vis iRobot vs rival robot vacs.\n\nSince then Amazon has also been named a gatekeeper under the EU\u2019s shiny new ex ante competition regulation, the Digital Markets Act \u2014 which lists its marketplace as a core platform service. This designation means Amazon must comply with a series of up-front obligations, which include restrictions on self preferencing."

        "body": "Days after a privacy complaint was lodged against Meta in the European Union over its latest controversial shift of legal basis claimed for processing people\u2019s data for ads, consumer groups across the region are filing their own complaints about what the tracking giant is up to.\n\nA coalition of almost 20 consumer protection organizations is united in the view that Meta\u2019s switch to railroading users into agreeing to being tracked and profiled so it can keep profiting from microtargeting them is \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cillegal\u201d \u2014 breaching EU consumer protection law \u201con several counts\u201d.\n\nStarting this month, EU users of Meta\u2019s social networks, Facebook and Instagram, are being offered the \u2018choice\u2019 of agreeing to being tracked and profiled by the behavioral ads business in order to continue/get free access to its products \u2014 or else they must pay it a monthly subscription (of at least \u20ac9.99pm) for an ad-free version of its mainstream social networks. So Meta\u2019s updated offer to EU users is either hand over your privacy or hand over your hard earned cash.\n\n\u201cThis is an unfair choice for users, which runs afoul of EU consumer law on several counts and must be stopped,\u201d said the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) in a press release announcing the complaint will be filed with the network of consumer protection authorities (CPC) today.\n\nBEUC has been joined in the complaint by 18 of its member organizations \u2014 a variety of consumer advocacy groups which are located in the following EU member states: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.\n\nThe groups are objecting both to how Meta has gone about implementing the \u201cpay-or-consent model\u201d \u2014 using what they assess as \u201cunfair, deceptive and aggressive practices\u201d \u2014 and to the model itself, which they dub \u201cillegal\u201d. They have also raised data protection concerns which are already the focus of the complaint sent to the Austrian data protection authority earlier this week by the privacy rights not-for-profit, noyb.\n\nCommenting in a statement, Ursula Pachl, deputy director general of BEUC, said:\n\nThe choice the tech giant is currently providing to consumers is unfair and illegal \u2014 the millions of European users of Facebook and Instagram deserve far better than this. Meta is breaching EU consumer law by using unfair, deceptive and aggressive practices, including partially blocking consumers from using the services to force them to take a decision quickly, and providing misleading and incomplete information in the process. Consumer protection authorities in the EU must now spring into action and force the tech giant to stop this practice.\n\nSummarizing the issues identified with Meta\u2019s model under consumer protection law BEUC writes:\n\nMeta is partially blocking the use of Facebook and Instagram until users have selected one option or the other, which constitutes an aggressive practice under European consumer law. Through persistence and by creating a sense of urgency, Meta pushes consumers into making a choice they might not want to take.\n\nIn addition, many consumers likely think that, by opting for the paid subscription as it is presented, they get a privacy-friendly option involving less tracking and profiling. In fact, users are likely to continue to have their personal data collected and used, but for purposes other than ads.\n\nMeta provides misleading and incomplete information to consumers which does not allow them to make an informed choice. Meta is misleading them by presenting the choice as between a paying and a \u2018free\u2019 option, while the latter option is not \u2018free\u2019 because consumers pay Meta through the provision of their data, as past court rulings have already declared.\n\nGiven the market power of Meta\u2019s Facebook and Instagram services in the EU and the very strong network effects of social media platforms (since all your friends are on Facebook and Instagram), consumers do not have a real choice because if they quit the services they would lose all their contacts and interactions built over the years. The very high subscription fee for \u2018ad-free\u2019 services is also a deterrent for consumers, which means consumers do not have a real choice.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s approach also raises concerns regarding the GDPR,\u201d Pachl further noted. And a spokesman for BEUC told us it might, at a later stage, file a complaint about Meta\u2019s data protection compliance with the relevant privacy authority, once it has completed its own assessment of the issues. Although he emphasized it\u2019s too early to say whether or not it will take that step.\n\nMeta\u2019s lead data protection authority in the EU, Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission (DPC), has, for several months, been assessing its pay or consent offer. But it has yet to communicate a conclusion. In the meanwhile, Meta maintains that the model it has devised for obtaining users\u2019 consent to its ads processing complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). (Although the adtech giant also said that when it was claiming performance of a contract and then legitimate interests for the processing \u2014 both of which were subsequently found to be incompatible with the GDPR.)\n\nThe \u2018pay or okay\u2019 model Meta is seeking to impose on EU users wasn\u2019t actually its invention; it was \u2018pioneered\u2019 in Austria, by the daily newspaper Der Standard \u2014 after which copycat cookie paywalls quickly sprung up on a raft of news publishers in Germany and elsewhere in the EU.\n\nnoyb has been challenging this \u2018pay or okay\u2019 approach to GDPR consent since 2021\u2014 filing complaints with a number of data protection authorities, arguing the model forces newspaper readers to \u201cbuy back their own data at exorbitant prices\u201d.\n\nSome DPAs appear to have been sympathetic to local newspapers\u2019 use of cookie walls, seeing it as a way to support the production of journalism. However when it comes to Meta, that argument evaporates as it\u2019s definitely not in the journalism business. Moreover the adtech giant doesn\u2019t even need to produce content to pump around its social networks; it gets all that filler for free from the self-same users it\u2019s now demanding pay a fee if they want to use its services without being tracked and profiled for behavioral advertising. Which, well, makes Meta\u2019s \u2018pay or okay\u2019 model feel like even more of a rip off.\n\nBack in April, a decision by Austria\u2019s DPA on a noyb complaint about cookie paywalls said users must have the ability to say yes or no to specific data operations \u2014 meaning blanket consent is not an option. But the result left it unclear how cookie paywalls might be operated in a way that\u2019s GDPR compliant and the privacy rights group vowed to fight the decision in court. \u201cThe final decision on \u2018pay or okay\u2019 may be made by the European Court of Justice (CJEU) in the long run,\u201d noyb predicted at the time.\n\nMeta is likely banking on another multi year round of GDPR complaints, legal challenges and \u2014 finally \u2014 a referral to the CJEU, followed by another long wait before a ruling gets handed down, buying it several more years to run with its new legal basis fix and keep feeding its profits by doing what it likes with Europeans\u2019 data.\n\nBut the consumer protection challenge could complicate its usual playbook.\n\nThe CPC has brought more coordinated action on consumer protection concerns in the EU in recent years, bringing multiple consumer groups together to tackle common concerns \u2014 helped by one or more national consumer protection authority which gets appointed to drive the effort. The process also loops in the European Commission to help facilitate dialogue, assess issues and bring pressure to bear on unfair practices.\n\nThe CPC alert and mobilization process can be quicker than GDPR enforcement when it comes to forcing changes to unfair behaviors. Although it still typically takes months, plural, for the network to coordinate and arrive at a position to press on a trader they believe is infringing the law.\n\nThe network also can\u2019t impose fines itself. But if issues aren\u2019t resolved through the dialogues and commitments process it shoots for, national consumer protection authorities can still pursue enforcement at a local level. So if, at the end of the day, these consumer advocacy groups aren\u2019t happy with whatever the process of pressing Meta for changes will have achieved they can still press complaints to national authorities to urge them to take enforcement action (and those CPAs have the ability to impose penalties of up to 4% of global annual turnover).\n\nIn recent times, a raft of complaints to the CPC about TikTok led \u2014 just last year \u2014 to the video sharing social network pledging to improve user reporting and disclosure requirements around ads/sponsored content; and to boost transparency around its digital coins and virtual gifts. Although BEUC was not ecstatic about the outcome, saying significant concerns remained unaddressed.\n\nStill, the CPC network may be able to extract some \u2018quick win\u2019 concessions from Meta \u2014 such as requiring it to amend how it presents the available \u2018Hobson\u2019s choice\u2019 to users. Meta could also potentially face pressure to lower the subscription fee to make it more more affordable for users to deny tracking. (Just spitballing here but imagine if it were offering a choice of tracking ads vs paying \u20ac1 a year not to be tracked which wouldn\u2019t look so evidently self-serving.)\n\nAsked whether the issue for consumer protection authorities is the \u2018pay or consent\u2019 choice Meta is offering or how it\u2019s gone about implementing it, BEUC\u2019s spokesman said the questions are hard to separate as they\u2019re \u201cclosely interlinked\u201d.\n\n\u201cUnder consumer law, you need an informed and fair choice to purchase such a subscription. The first question is also dependent on compliance with data protection law. If the practice infringes the GDPR, the fact that it infringes a law which aims to protect fundamental rights should in our opinion be considered unfair and illegal under consumer law too,\u201d he told us, adding: \u201cIn any case, the choice is designed in a way that is unfair, aggressive and misleading.\u201d\n\nThe European Commission itself has an additional oversight role on Meta directly as the company is also subject to the EU\u2019s shiny new Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA). In the latter case its social networks, Facebook and Instagram, were designated as very large online platforms (VLOPs) earlier this year. And, since late August, they\u2019ve been expected to be compliant with that digital rulebook.\n\nBoth pan-EU laws put restrictions on the use of personal data for advertising \u2014 explicitly requiring consent is obtained from users for such a purpose; and that consent must be as easy to withhold as to affirm. So one issue the Commission \u2014 which is the sole enforcer of the DSA on VLOPs \u2014 might weigh in in the coming months on is whether clicking accept vs digging out a credit card to pay a monthly charge are equivalently easy.\n\nThe regulation also contains provisions which are intended to combat unfair/deceptive design, such as targeting choice interfaces that make it \u201cmore difficult or time-consuming\u201d to pick one option over another. Although the DSA\u2019s provisions against dark patterns are only intended to be applied where consumer protection and privacy laws, which also take aim against unfair choices, don\u2019t."

        "body": "The political deal clinched by European Union lawmakers late Friday over what the bloc is billing as world\u2019s first comprehensive law for regulating artificial intelligence includes powers for the Commission to adapt the pan-EU AI rulebook to keep pace with developments in the cutting edge field, it has confirmed.\n\nLawmakers\u2019 choice of term for regulating the most powerful models behind the current boom in generative AI tools \u2014 which the EU Act refers to as \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d AI models and systems, rather than using industry terms of choice, like \u201cfoundational\u201d or \u201cfrontier\u201d models \u2014 was also selected with an eye on futureproofing the incoming law, per the Commission, with co-legislators favoring a generic term to avoid a classification that could be chained to use of a specific technology (i.e. transformer based machine learning).\n\n\u201cIn the future, we may have different technical approaches. And so we were looking for a more generic term,\u201d a Commission official suggested today. \u201cFoundation models, of course, are part of the general purpose AI models. These are models that can be used for a very large variety of tasks, they can also be integrated in systems. To give you a concrete example, the general purpose AI model would be GPT-4 and the general purpose AI system would be ChatGPT \u2014 where GPT-4 is integrated in ChatGPT.\u201d\n\nAs we reported earlier, the deal agreed by the bloc\u2019s co-legislators includes a low risk tier and a high risk tier for regulating so-called general purpose AIs (GPAIs) \u2014 such as models behind the viral boom in generative AI tools like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. The trigger for high risk rules to apply on generative AI technologies is determined by an initial threshold set out in the law.\n\nAlso as we reported Thursday, the agreed draft of the EU AI Act references the amount of compute used to train the models, aka floating point operations (or FLOPs) \u2014 setting the bar for a GPAI to be considered to have \u201chigh impact capabilities\u201d at 10^25 FLOPs.\n\nBut during a technical briefing with journalists today to review the political deal the Commission confirmed this is just an \u201cinitial threshold\u201d, affirming it will have powers to update the threshold over time via implementing/delegating acts (i.e. secondary legislation). It also said the idea is for the FLOPs threshold to be combined, over time, with \u201cother benchmarks\u201d that will be developed by a new expert oversight body to be set up within the Commission, called the AI Office.\n\nWhy was 25 FLOPs selected as the high risk threshold for GPAIs? The Commission suggests the figure was picked with the intention of capturing current gen frontier models. However it claimed lawmakers did not discuss nor even considered whether it would apply to any models currently in play, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 or Google\u2019s Gemini, during the marathon trilogues to agree the final shape of the rulebook.\n\nA Commission official added that it will, in any case, be up to makers of GPAIs to self assess whether their models meet the FLOPs threshold and, therefore, whether they fall under the rules for GPAIs \u201cwith systemic risk\u201d or not.\n\n\u201cThere are no official sources that will say ChatGPT or Gemini or Chinese models are at this level of FLOPs,\u201d the official said during the press briefing. \u201cOn the basis of the information we have and with this 10^25 that we have chosen we have chosen a number that could really capture, a little bit, the frontier models that we have. Whether this is capturing GPT-4 or Gemini or others we are not here now to assert \u2014 because also, in our framework, it is the companies that would have to come and self assess what the amount of FLOPs or the computing capacity they have used. But, of course, if you read the scientific literature, many will point to these numbers as being very much the most advanced models at the moment. We will see what the companies will assess because they\u2019re the best placed to make this assessment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rules have not been written keeping in mind certain companies,\u201d they added. \u201cThey\u2019ve really been written with the idea of defining the threshold \u2014 which, by the way, may change because we have the possibility to be empowered to change this threshold on the basis of technological evolution. It could go up, it could go down and we could also develop other benchmarks that in the future will be the more appropriate to benchmark the different moments.\u201d\n\nGPAIs that fall in the AI Act\u2019s high risk tier will face ex ante-style regulatory requirements to assess and mitigate systemic risks \u2014 meaning they must proactively test model outputs to shrink risks of actual (or \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d) negative effects on public health, safety, public security, fundamental rights, or for society as a whole.\n\nWhile \u201clow tier\u201d GPAIs will only face lighter transparency requirements, including obligations to apply watermarking to generative AI outputs.\n\nThe watermarking requirement for GPAIs falls in an article that was in the original Commission version of the risk-based framework, presented all the way back in April 2021, which focused on transparency requirements for technologies such as AI chatbots and deepfakes \u2014 but which will now also apply generally to general purpose AI systems.\n\n\u201cThere is an obligation to try to watermark [generative AI-produced] text on the basis of the latest state of the art technology that is available,\u201d the Commission official said, fleshing out details of the agreed watermarking obligations. \u201cAt the moment, technologies are much better at watermarking videos and audio than watermarking text. But what we ask is the fact that this watermarking takes place on the basis of state of the art technology \u2014 and then we expect, of course, that over time the technology will mature and will be as [good] as possible.\u201d\n\nGPAI model makers must also commit to respecting EU copyright rules, including complying with an existing machine readable opt-out from text and data mining contained in the EU Copyright Directive \u2014 and a carve-out of the Act\u2019s transparency requirements for open source GPAIs does not extend to cutting them loose from the copyright obligations, with the Commission confirming the Copyright Directive will still apply on open source GPAIs.\n\nAs regards the AI Office, which will play a key role in setting risk classification thresholds for GPAIs, the Commission confirmed there\u2019s no budget nor headcount defined for the expert body as yet. (Although, in the small hours of Saturday morning the bloc\u2019s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, suggested the EU is set to welcome \u201ca lot\u201d of new colleagues as it tools up this general purpose AI oversight body.)\n\nAsked about resourcing for the AI Office, a Commission official said it will be decided in the future by the EU\u2019s executive taking \u201can appropriate and official decision\u201d. \u201cThe idea is that we can create a dedicated budget line for the Office and that we will be able also to recruit the national experts from Member States if we wish to on top of contractual agents and on top of permanent staff. And some of these staff will also be deployed within the European Commission,\u201d they added.\n\nThe AI Office will work in conjunction with a new scientific advisory panel the law will also establish to aid the body to better understand the capabilities of advanced AI models for the purpose of regulating systemic risk. \u201cWe have identified an important role for a scientific panel to be set up where the scientific panel can effectively help the Artificial Intelligence Office in understanding whether there are new risks that have not been yet identified,\u201d the official noted. \u201cAnd, for example, also flag some alerts about the models that are not captured by the FLOP threshold that for certain reasons could actually give rise to important risks that governments should should look at.\u201d\n\nWhile the EU\u2019s executive seems keen to ensure key details of the incoming law are put out there in spite of there being no final text yet \u2014 because work to consolidate what was agreed by co-legislators during the marathon 38 hour talks that ended on Friday night is the next task facing the bloc over the coming weeks \u2014 there could still be some devils lurking in that detail. So it will be worth scrutinizing the text that emerges, likely in January or February.\n\nAdditionally, while the full regulation won\u2019t be up and running for a few years the EU will be pushing for GPAIs to abide by codes of practice in the meanwhile \u2014 so AI giants will be under pressure to stick as close to the hard regulations coming down the pipe as possible, via the bloc\u2019s AI Pact.\n\nThe EU AI Act itself likely won\u2019t be in full force until some time in 2026 \u2014 given the final text must, once compiled (and translated into Member States\u2019 languages), be affirmed by final votes in the parliament and Council, after which there\u2019s a short period before the text of the law is published in the EU\u2019s Official Journal and another before it comes into force.\n\nEU lawmakers have also agreed a phased approach to the Act\u2019s compliance demands, with 24 months allowed before the high risk rules will apply for GPAIs.\n\nThe list of strictly prohibited use-cases of AI will apply sooner, just six months after the law enters into force \u2014 which could, potentially, mean bans on certain \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d uses of AI, such as social scoring or Clearview AI-style selfie scraping for facial recognition databases, will get up and running in the second half of 2024, assuming no last minute opposition to the regulation springs up within the Council or Parliament. (For the full list of banned AI uses, read our earlier post.)"

        "body": "It\u2019s official! Elon Musk\u2019s X marks the spot of the first confirmed investigation opened by the European Union under its rebooted digital rulebook, the Digital Services Act (DSA).\n\nAnnouncing the opening of a \u201cformal proceeding\u201d today, the European Commission said the investigation will look at whether the social networking platform may have breached rules linked to risk management, content moderation, dark patterns, advertising transparency and data access for researchers.\n\nThe opening of a formal DSA investigation on X comes hard on the heels of a complaint against X\u2019s adtech by privacy rights group, noyb \u2014 although today\u2019s formal proceeding is unlikely to be directly linked as the Commission has been probing the platform for months via a flurry of requests for information. Its earlier actions were focused on concerns about the spread of illegal content and disinformation related to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nBack in October the Commission sent Musk\u2019s company an \u201curgent\u201d formal request for information about how it was responding to information risks arising out of the conflict. The EU also said then it was looking at X\u2019s compliance across a number of areas, including policies and practices regarding notices on illegal content, complaint handling, risk assessment and measures to mitigate the risks identified \u2014 and it gave X until the end of October to respond.\n\n\u201cOn the basis of the preliminary investigation conducted so far, including on the basis of an analysis of the risk assessment report submitted by X in September, X\u2019s Transparency report published on 3 November, and X\u2019s replies to a formal request for information, which, among others, concerned the dissemination of illegal content in the context of Hamas\u2019 terrorist attacks against Israel, the Commission has decided to open formal infringement proceedings against X under the Digital Services Act,\u201d the EU said today.\n\nPer the Commission, the EU\u2019s investigation of X focuses on the following areas and issues:\n\nCompliance with DSA obligations related to countering the dissemination of illegal content in the EU \u2014 \u201c notably in relation to the risk assessment and mitigation measures adopted by X to counter the dissemination of illegal content in the EU, as well as the functioning of the notice and action mechanism for illegal content in the EU mandated by the DSA, including in light of X\u2019s content moderation resources\n\n\u2014 \u201c The effectiveness of measures taken by X to combat info manipulation \u2014 with a focus on the effectiveness of its \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d system of crowdsourcing fact-checking to aggregated views of users, who may vote to label disputed tweets with additional context. The EU said the probe will also look at the effectiveness of \u201crelated policies mitigating risks to civic discourse and electoral processes\u201d\n\n\u2014 with a focus on the effectiveness of its \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d system of crowdsourcing fact-checking to aggregated views of users, who may vote to label disputed tweets with additional context. The EU said the probe will also look at the Transparency requirements \u2014 with a focus on \u201csuspected shortcomings\u201d by X in giving researchers access to publicly accessible data as mandated by Article 40 of the DSA, and suspected shortcomings in its ads repository (aka the ads transparency library the regulation also mandates)\n\n\u2014 with a focus on \u201csuspected shortcomings\u201d by X in giving researchers access to publicly accessible data as mandated by Article 40 of the DSA, and suspected shortcomings in its ads repository (aka the ads transparency library the regulation also mandates) Suspected deceptive design elements in X\u2019s user interface \u2014 \u201cnotably in relation to checkmarks linked to certain subscription products, the so-called Blue checks\u201d\n\n\u201cIf proven, these failures would constitute infringements of Articles 34(1), 34(2) and 35(1), 16(5) and 16(6), 25(1), 39 and 40(12) of the DSA,\u201d the EU added \u2014 saying it will now carry out an in-depth investigation \u201cas a matter of priority\u201d.\n\nToday we open formal infringement proceedings against @X : \u26a0\ufe0f Suspected breach of obligations to counter #IllegalContent and #Disinformation \u26a0\ufe0f Suspected breach of #Transparency obligations \u26a0\ufe0f Suspected #DeceptiveDesign of user interface#DSA pic.twitter.com/NxKIif603k \u2014 Thierry Breton (@ThierryBreton) December 18, 2023\n\nThe Commission is responsible for enforcing the DSA on larger platforms such as X \u2014 which was designated a very large online platform (VLOP) under the DSA back in April. Confirmed breaches of the online governance regime can face a range of major sanctions, including fines of up to 6% of global annual turnover.\n\nThe EU can also apply interim measures where it believes there\u2019s a risk of serious harm for users and may even seek to have access to infringing services temporarily blocked. Although its announcement today is careful to caveat the development by affirming no conclusions have yet been reached.\n\nThere is also no confirmed timeline for the probe to conclude. But the fact of it being opened means other tools are put within reach of regulators and could be applied if the EU sees the need to act quickly \u2014 such as the aforementioned interim measures. So the Commission\u2019s official scrutiny of X could have real world implications for how the platform operates sooner rather than later.\n\nReached for a response to the EU probe, X\u2019s Joe Benarroch \u2014 who was brought into the company by CEO Linda Yaccarino relatively recently to work on business operations \u2014 said:\n\nX remains committed to complying with the Digital Services Act, and is cooperating with the regulatory process. It is important that this process remains free of political influence and follows the law. X is focused on creating a safe and inclusive environment for all users on our platform, while protecting freedom of expression, and we will continue to work tirelessly towards this goal.\n\nWhile X under Musk has very evidently been flying the ship in the opposite direction to the responsible governance the DSA intends to encourage \u2014 hence attracting so many warnings from EU lawmakers, even long before today\u2019s formal probe \u2014 it\u2019s notable X recently started offering a research program for outsiders to get data to systemic risks arising on the platform in the EU. However the Commission obviously has doubts X has gone far enough on the transparency front to meet the DSA\u2019s bar.\n\nEU regulators are also set to assess Musk & co\u2019s claims that replacing a formal content moderation function with crowdsourced opinions is a valid approach to tackling diverse information risks; and, consequently, to look into how much Musk\u2019s gutting of content moderation teams and processes has cost X\u2019s users in terms of harm exposure.\n\nTo say the Commission\u2019s investigation looks fascinating and timely is an understatement.\n\nEU lawmakers can certainly bask in the glow of being prepared for the possibility of an erratic billionaire running a wrecking ball through a major social platform. But of course they will need to follow through \u2014 and it\u2019s clear the real work is just starting. So this probe looks set to be a test of how much stomach the EU has to actually enforce the rules it loves to lay down on paper.\n\nThe investigation may also test Musk\u2019s mettle for what could be an expensive head-on clash with EU regulators. Time will tell how this one plays out but he may find the dead blue bird he\u2019s chosen to hang around his neck, when he purposefully ripped up the standard content moderation rulebook and opted to channel online chaos, starting to feel like it\u2019s dragging him down."

        "body": "ETF provider Betashares, which manages $30 billion in funds, reached an agreement to acquire Bendigo and Adelaide Bank\u2019s superannuation business, in its first venture into the superannuation sector. Betashares said it was part of a longer-term strategy to expand the business into the broader financial sector. Shares in Bendigo increased 0.6 per cent on the news. REITS (up 0.4 per cent) was the strongest sector on the index as Goodman added 0.5 per cent and Dexus climbed 2.8 per cent. The laggards Casino operator Star Entertainment Group\u2019s shares hit an all-time low of 60\u00a2 after it raised $565 million. They closed the session 16 per cent weaker at 63\u00a2. Star, which raised $800 million in February, has had to return to the market for fresh funding and is hoping to raise $750 million at a share price of 60\u00a2 a share.\n\nMeanwhile, healthcare heavyweight CSL shed 1.4 per cent, weighing down the healthcare sector and insurance companies IAG (down 2.6 per cent) and Suncorp (down 2 per cent) gave back some of their gains from Tuesday. Gold miners Newcrest (down 2.1 per cent) and Evolution (down 3.5 per cent) were also among the biggest large-cap decliners after the spot gold price dropped 0.9 per cent overnight. Information technology (down 1.1 per cent) was the weakest sector on the local bourse with WiseTech losing 1.4 per cent. The lowdown\n\nNovus Capital senior client adviser Gary Glover said the Australian sharemarket was surprisingly resilient following a negative lead from Wall Street and the latest inflation data, with markets starting to wake up to the fact that interest rates could stay higher for longer. \u201cConsidering the damage overnight in the US, Australian markets held on pretty well,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it would be a bigger down day across the board.\u201d Glover said the market was volatile but quite range-bound, similar to previous periods of high inflation in the 1940s and 1970s. Elsewhere, Wall Street\u2019s ugly September got even worse on Tuesday, as a sharp drop for stocks brought them back to where they were in June. The S&P 500 tumbled 1.5 per cent for its fifth loss in the last six days. The Dow Jones dropped 1.1 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.6 per cent.\n\nLoading September has brought a loss of 5.2 per cent so far for the S&P 500, putting it on track to be the worst month of the year by far, as the realisation sets in that the Federal Reserve will indeed keep interest rates high for a long time. That growing understanding has sent yields in the bond market to their highest levels in more than a decade, which in turn has undercut prices for stocks and other investments. Treasury yields rose again on Tuesday following a mixed batch of reports on the economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4.55 per cent from 4.54 per cent late on Monday and is near its highest level since 2007. It\u2019s up sharply from about 3.5 per cent in May and from 0.5 per cent about three years ago. One economic report on Tuesday showed confidence among consumers was weaker than economists expected. That\u2019s concerning because strong spending by US households has been a bulwark keeping the economy out of a long-predicted recession.\n\nBesides high interest rates, a long list of other worries is also tugging at Wall Street. The most immediate is the threat of another US government shutdown as Capitol Hill threatens a stalemate that could shut off federal services across the country. Loading Wall Street has dealt with such shutdowns in the past, and stocks have historically been turbulent in the run-up to them, according to Lori Calvasina, strategist at RBC Capital Markets. After looking at the seven shutdowns that lasted 10 days or more since the 1970s, she found the S&P 500 dropped an average of roughly 10 per cent in the three months heading into them. But stocks managed to hold up rather well during the shutdowns, falling an average of just 0.3 per cent, before rebounding meaningfully afterward. Wall Street is also contending with higher oil prices, shaky economies around the world, a strike by US autoworkers that could put more upward pressure on inflation and a resumption of US student-loan repayments that could dent spending by households.\n\nOn Wall Street, the vast majority of stocks fell under such pressures, including 90 per cent of those within the S&P 500. Big Tech stocks tend to be among the hardest hit by high rates, and they were the heaviest weights on the index. Apple fell 2.3 per cent and Microsoft lost 1.7 per cent. Amazon tumbled 4 per cent after the Federal Trade Commission and 17 state attorneys general filed an antitrust lawsuit against it. They accuse the e-commerce behemoth of using its dominant position to inflate prices on other platforms, overcharge sellers and stifle competition. In China, concerns continued over heavily indebted real estate developer Evergrande. The property market crisis there is dragging on China\u2019s economic growth and raising worries about financial instability. France\u2019s CAC 40 fell 0.7 per cent, and Germany\u2019s DAX lost 1 per cent.\n\nCrude oil prices rose, adding to worries about inflation. A barrel of benchmark US crude climbed 71\u00a2 to $US90.39. Brent crude, the international standard, added 67\u00a2 to $US93.96 per barrel. Tweet of the day Quote of the day \u201cThe Senate committees have the power to summons witnesses within Australia but have no enforceable powers for witnesses who are overseas,\u201d said Senator Bridget McKenzie as former Qantas boss Alan Joyce chose not to front the Senate select committee into the federal government\u2019s decision to reject extra flights from Qatar Airways due to \u201cpersonal commitments\u201d."

        "body": "Amazon Prime Day Part II is here, and that means a fresh batch of Prime Day deals. Technically Amazon calls this Prime Big Deal Days, but like most people, we think of it as Prime Day Deux. As usual, most of these Prime Day deals require a Prime membership, but you can snag a 30-day free trial to make the most of the event. We've been combing Amazon's website to bring you the best discounts on laptops, tablets, kitchen and home gear, headphones, and plenty more.\n\nWe test products year-round and handpicked these deals. Products that are sold out or no longer discounted as of publishing will be crossed out. We'll update this guide regularly throughout Prime Day by adding fresh deals and removing dead deals.\n\nWIRED Featured Deals\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\nBest Prime Day Amazon Device Deals\n\nThe discount will apply automatically during checkout once you meet the $40 order threshold on select products. Amazon-branded products range from home essentials like paper towels and batteries to snacks, office supplies, over-the-counter medicines, and more. This deal is an easy way to stock up on frequently-used items for cheap.\n\nGift card deals are only worthwhile if you'd be spending the money anyway. With brands like Doordash, Instacart, Fandango, and more featured in this sale, chances are you can find a worthy discount. Each card has a unique coupon code listed on the product page. Enter it during checkout to save.\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nAmazon devices are almost always going on sale, but this is an especially nice deal since it comes with a free smart plug that typically sells for about $20. It isn't the same exact model, but a similar Kasa plug is the top pick in our Best Smart Plugs guide. The Echo Dot (5th Gen) is one of our favorite Alexa speakers. You can use the included smart plug to do things like ask Alexa to turn off your box fan or turn on a lamp.\n\nAmazon has a bunch of private-label clearance on sale for up to 55 percent off. Want D-cell batteries for $5? Here you go. How about compostable plates for $8? Giant crayons for $9? A truly hideous fanny pack for $12? The point is, there are 10 pages full of random items to choose from, and all of them are cheap. Go wild.\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nOther Echo Show devices are also on sale, but the Echo Show 8 is our favorite. This product comes with a free trial of Alexa Together, an Amazon service that aims to replicate the tasks of a caregiver. It usually costs $20 per month. Set a reminder to cancel it if you aren't interested in subsequent charges.\n\nThe Echo Studio is the best-sounding Alexa speaker, but it's also pretty expensive. This price matches a low we've seen just once before. It has more powerful sound in general, but the changes are especially noticeable on the low end. Check out our Best Smart Speakers guide for additional details and recommendations.\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nThis matches the price we saw in July for the best Kindle for kids. It's waterproof and has adjustable warm lighting for reading at night. If your kid is really into the Warrior Cats books, there is a special edition just for them for $120. The standard Kindle Kids is also on sale and it's a bit cheaper at $80 ($40 off), but it lacks the adjustable warm lighting and waterproofing. Whichever you get, Amazon throws in a protective case, a one-year subscription to Amazon Kids+, and a two-year no-questions-asked replacement guarantee.\n\nThe other Kindles are more affordable, so there's no practical reason to spend the cash for the Oasis. But if you're like me and love physical page-turn buttons, you may want to consider this one. We think it's probably due for an update soon though.\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nIf you like to take digital notes, the Kindle Scribe (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the first of Amazon's e-readers that lets you write on the enormous 10.2-inch screen like a regular notebook. However, if you want to write in the margins of books, you'll have to settle for using sticky notes. That's frustrating given the point of spending this kind of money is to write on it (marking up books is better on the Kobo Elipsa).\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nThe Fire Max 11 (5/10, WIRED Review) is Amazon's biggest, nicest, and most overpriced Fire tablet. This deal makes it much more palatable. The display and new fingerprint sensor are nice, as is the ability to use the keyboard without resorting to Bluetooth, but the Fire OS operating system leaves much to be desired (like a decent app store). Still, if you're set on a Fire tablet and you want a big display, this isn't a bad deal.\n\nBest Prime Day Laptop and Accessory Deals\n\nMacBook Air Photograph: Apple\n\nThe 2023 MacBook Air (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite laptops this year. It has an excellent six-speaker sound system, a 1080p front-facing webcam, and a 10-core variant of the M2 processor the previous year's model came with. It's blazingly fast for most normal work and can even handle some light video editing and other heavier tasks.\n\nThis is last year's 13-inch MacBook Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) with the M2 chip and Touch Bar. It has the same processor that's in the new MacBook Air (our top pick for most people) and doesn't offer any major hardware upgrades except for a fan, which allows the processor to get a little warmer and eke out more power over a longer period of time. This helps if you\u2019re working on pro-level tasks like video editing but can\u2019t spend the premium that Apple charges for its bigger Pro models.\n\nThe Razer Blade 14 earned an 8/10, WIRED Recommends award in our review. It has a gorgeous 16:10 display, plenty of USB ports, a full-size HDMI output, and an Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti, with the option to upgrade to the 40-series, giving it plenty of power to tear through the toughest games. It's the laptop WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft used through Starfield's launch weekend; it has proven its worth already.\n\nPhotograph: Das Keyboard\n\nYou may have to click on \u201cSee More Buying Options\u201d to see this deal. The Das Keyboard MacTigr pairs well with Apple's laptops and PCs. It has a dedicated Mac layout, Cherry MX Red switches, a two-port USB-C hub, and a high-quality, all-metal build. It rarely goes on sale.\n\nThis is our favorite external keyboard in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. It's a great option if you're a fan of the Magic Keyboard and are looking to fully replicate your MacBook setup. However, this version is fairly bare-bones\u2014it doesn't come with a Touch ID button or the same function row keys as the M-series MacBooks (that model isn't on sale, sadly). But it does come with the standard keys like playback controls, a Mission Control key, as well as a number pad. This is also the lowest price we've tracked for this keyboard, so far.\n\nThe Studio Display (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has a spacious 27-inch display that's perfect for juggling multiple apps at the same time and a 5K resolution that's stunningly sharp (there's no HDR though, so colors look slightly more contrasty and saturated compared to the neutral tones on Apple's Pro Display XDR). Although it's pricey, this is an excellent monitor for those who want a really accurate and sharp screen. Equipped with a 12-megapixel camera, along with built-in mics and speakers, it's ideal for video calls too. This is also the lowest price we've tracked, yet.\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nOne of our top picks from our building your own PC guide, AMD's 16-core behemoth is a killer CPU for high-end 4K or 144-Hz gaming. It has some special requirements. It gets so hot there's no way you should put it into a PC without a liquid cooler like the Asus ROG Ryujin II Liquid Cooler.\n\nPlugable's USB-C Triple Display Docking Station is a great choice, especially for anyone using more than one monitor. It supports up to three displays at once (either HDMI or DisplayPort for each). The dock also packs six USB 3.0 ports (two on the front, four in the back) and a gigabit Ethernet port. Whenever you come back to your workstation with your MacBook, all you have to do is plug it in and you instantly have a multi-monitor setup. With an output of up to 60 watts, you can use the dock to charge your laptop too.\n\nClaiming the top spot in our Best USB Flash Drives guide, the SanDisk Extreme Pro balances speed, reliability, and price. The sleek aluminum case has a loop for attaching it to a keyring and a slider to push out the USB-A plug. It is fast, performs reliably (we've been using one regularly for two years), and comes with a lifetime warranty.\n\nBest Prime Day Tablet Deals\n\nPhotograph: OnePlus\n\nThe OnePlus Pad (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the few Android tablets we think is a worthy iPad alternative. It offers good performance, has great battery life, and an excellent 144-Hz, 11.6-inch LCD display. We strongly recommend OnePlus\u2019 magnetic keyboard, which is also on sale for $100 ($50 off), however, if you purchase directly from the company's website, you can get the keyboard bundled for free.\n\nThe 9th-gen iPad (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite iPad for most people, even though it's one generation behind. Aside from costing less than the current 10th-gen model, it is still compatible with the same accessories as the first-gen Apple Pencil. It retains the physical Home button with Touch ID at the bottom of the screen.\n\nPixel Tablet Photograph: Google\n\nGoogle's Pixel Tablet (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is part tablet, part smart display. It comes with a charging dock that doubles as a speaker, so you can pump out the tunes and get answers from Google Assistant at a moment's notice. Take it off the charger and you get a full Android tablet experience.\n\nBest Prime Day Watch Deals\n\nPhotograph: Apple\n\nThe 2nd-generation Apple Watch SE is our top pick for most people. It's the most affordable of what Apple touts as its first carbon-neutral products (when bought in conjunction with the new sport loop, that is). It's compatible with WatchOS 10, which is where many new health and wellness features show up.\n\nThe second-generation Garmin Epix Pro holds the title of Best Outdoor Watch in our Best Fitness Trackers guide and is one of our favorite sports watches (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It has a bright AMOLED display, battery life that can last through a week of camping, and useful features like redshift mode (for training outside at night), and a flashlight. There's also an endurance feature, in addition to all the other Garmin proprietary metrics that assess what kind of shape you're in. This deal applies to the 51-mm size, but the 42-mm and 47-mm sizes are also on sale.\n\nWe liked (but didn't love) the Withings Move smartwatch when we tried it. One of our chief complaints was its lack of heart rate monitoring, but that's an issue the Withings Steel HR has resolved, adding this crucial feature to what was already an elegant, subtle smartwatch. It has typical analog watch hands, with a smaller monochrome display for basic data, and it won't buzz your wrist all day with every single notification.\n\nGot an Android phone? We really liked using the TicWatch Pro 5, mostly because its battery stands out among competitors like Google, Samsung, and Apple. We easily get three days of average use, and Mobvoi\u2019s unique dual-display technology lets you stretch the battery life even further. It\u2019s powered by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon W5+ Gen 1 chipset, which is a newer and more efficient processor. And we've barely seen any hiccups operating this Wear OS 3 watch.\n\nBest Prime Day Phone Deals\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 Photograph: Samsung\n\nSamsung's new Galaxy Z Flip5 (7/10 WIRED Recommends) delivers a larger cover screen, which means you can do more on the phone without having to open it up. If you or someone you know always complain about how big phones are these days, a folding flip phone might be the answer to those woes. If you want to try a different style of flip phone, the Motorola Razr+ is also on sale for $800 ($100 off).\n\nPhotograph: Samsung\n\nDon't want to pay much for a phone? This is one of the best you'll find for the price (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It lacks wireless charging (see the Pixel 7A below if you really want it), but the AMOLED screen has a 120-Hz screen refresh rate, the performance is decent, and the cameras are reliable. The battery also lasts more than a day.\n\nGoogle Pixel 7A Photograph: Google\n\nThis is our favorite smartphone for most people (8/10, WIRED Recommends), and this is an incredible price (and the lowest we have tracked). It has smooth performance, a nice bright screen, excellent cameras, and even features like wireless charging. The battery life is just OK.\n\nWe have a lot of other good cheap phone recommendations here, but this Motorola is fine and performs well for the money. It will only get one OS update (to Android 14), but it will get three years of security updates. It comes with an NFC sensor so you can make contactless payments, a headphone jack, and a microSD card slot. Read our Best Motorola Phones guide for more.\n\nOnePlus 11 Photograph: OnePlus\n\nThe OnePlus 11 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is fast. The performance is fast, the recharging is fast. It even looks fast. It has a bright, 120-Hz AMOLED screen, great speakers, and surprisingly good battery life for all that. Our main gripe is the IP64 water- and dust-resistance rating, which is not nearly as good as other flagship phones.\n\nUgreen's charger is, as the name suggests, a 145-watt charger with a 25,000-mAh battery. It's surprisingly compact for the power it provides, although at 1.1 pounds, it's definitely not ultralight. There are two USB-C ports and one USB-A port. What sets the Ugreen apart is that you can actually draw 145 watts while charging. That works out to one USB-C port at 100W and the other at 45W. Very few other batteries we've tested are capable of that feat.\n\nPhotograph: Anker\n\nThe Anker Nano is one of our favorite portable power banks, particularly for phones. It clicks right into the bottom of your device, and even comes in fun colors. This model has a 12-watt Lightning connector but there is a 22.5-watt USB-C version for the iPhone 15 or Android phones for $22 ($10 off). Both connectors fold away when you aren't using them. If you use a particularly thick case, this may not work. You'll likely be able to charge most phones fully once before needing to recharge the power bank itself via the included USB-C cable.\n\nWe are big fans of the Backbone One (8/10, WIRED recommends) and it appears in our Best Mobile Game Controllers guide. It slides open to cradle your phone and is very responsive, with buttons and bumpers that feel nice and clicky. The USB-C version that is on sale will work with most Android phones and the new iPhone 15 range.\n\nThis 2-in-1 charger is featured in our guide to the Best MagSafe Accessories. The price matches the lowest we have tracked. It doesn't have a built-in Apple Watch charger, but it can top off your compatible wireless earbuds whilst simultaneously charging your iPhone. It charges at the maximum 15-watt rate, and you can turn your iPhone sideways for iOS 17\u2019s new StandBy mode, converting it into a bedside alarm clock.\n\nAnker 3-in-1 MagSafe Wireless Charging Dock Photograph: Anker\n\nAnker makes our favorite lists often, including with this super compact 3-in-1 wireless charger. A MagSafe pad charges iPhones up to 15 watts at a slanted angle, and on the side is a standard Apple Watch puck (no fast-charging support). In the space inside the triangle is where you can place your AirPods Pro (or any other wireless earbuds case) to top them up.\n\nThis 2.5-inch cube from Anker is a great compact charger. It comes with a MagSafe pad on top (that charges at up to 15 watts), a top section that hinges to a 60-degree angle to reveal a charging surface for your AirPods, and a shelf on the side that has a built-in Apple Watch charger (which can comfortably accommodate any Apple Watch including the Ultra). You'll also get a 5-foot cable and a 30-watt charger in the box. It supports fast charging too.\n\nAnker 737 Power Bank Photograph: Anker\n\nWe just added this power bank as our top upgrade pick in our guide to the Best Portable Chargers. It's pricey, but today's deal makes it more accessible. It charges from zero to completely full in an hour and boasts a whopping 24,000-mAh capacity. And it's powerful enough to charge laptops and tablets as well as phones and other gadgets. There's even a built-in display to monitor stats like temperature and remaining battery percentage.\n\nThis heavy metal brick is a good option for charging laptops and smaller gadgets. It packs 20,000 mAh and supports a wide variety of fast charging standards. There is one USB-C PD port rated at 65 watts, two USB-A QC ports at 30 watts apiece, and a micro-USB input (though you are best using the USB-C to recharge it). We haven't seen it go on sale very often.\n\nThis travel kit from ESR works well if you want something that can prop your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation. It can also display your Apple Watch in Nightstand mode, so you can peek and see how long before you must get out of bed. The main body folds open with a MagSafe charging pad for your iPhone and a slot behind for your AirPods. We have seen this dip a little lower, but this is still a solid deal.\n\nThe unusual design of Satechi's fold-up wireless charging stand allows it to charge both phones and a wireless earbuds case (if it supports Qi wireless charging), plus a USB-C port to plug in a third device\u2014not bad for a device that fits in your bag. It has a 10,000-mAh capacity with LEDs to show how much juice is left. The downside is that it is slow, offering up to 10 watts of wireless charging power for phones (7.5 watts for iPhones), 5 watts for earbuds, and 10 watts from the USB-C port.\n\nBest Prime Day Headphone Deals\n\nPhotograph: Sony\n\nWhile its predecessor was one of the best pairs of wireless earbuds around, the WF-1000XM5 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is still no slouch. They produce balanced sound, are comfortable to wear, and have active noise cancellation. When using the ANC, they last up to eight hours on a single charge, stretching to around 12 hours without it.\n\nThis deal is a match of historic low pricing that we don't see come around very often. The Google Pixel Buds Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are truly excellent earbuds\u2014particularly if you have an Android phone. They're comfortable and available in a wide array of colors at this price.\n\nThis is an invite-only deal (read more about that below). The Jabra Elite 7 Active top the list of our favorite workout earbuds. They came out in 2021, but are still the smallest, with the teeniest case, and the most comfortable we've tried. The rubber tip kept these securely in our ears while running, even while under a beanie that was rubbing against them. You can customize the level of ambient noise you let in via the Sound+ app, and they're IP57-rated to withstand sweat. You'll get 8 hours of battery life and up to 30 hours in the case.\n\nPhotograph: Apple\n\nIf you have an iPhone, these are the best earbuds. The newer USB-C model (8/10, WIRED Recommends), has redesigned audio infrastructure, and remains to have some of the best noise canceling and microphones we've heard on a pair of earbuds.\n\nAnker's Space A40 earbuds (8/10, WIRED Recommends) are packed with features for the price, with noise canceling, wireless charging, and 10 hours of battery life. Plus, they sound good, are lightweight, and comfortable to wear, which is why our reviewers say they nearly give Apple's AirPods a run for their money. Anker's Liberty 4 NC earbuds (8/10, WIRED Recommends) are another feature-packed pair of buds with great noise canceling, and are on sale for $80 ($20 off).\n\nThe Beats Studio Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) were released just a couple of months ago. We wish the battery life was longer and that the controls and EQ options were more robust. But this price makes them more worthwhile, and they do have excellent noise canceling.\n\nPhotograph: Bose\n\nThese noise-cancelling headphones are our favorite for the office. With advanced signal processing and four microphones built in, these will limit any sound around you, making them great for focusing on work in a busy environment and for Zoom calls. These often fluctuate in price, but we think it's a great deal.\n\nWe like Sony's standard LinkBuds (8/10, WIRED Recommends) for the open-ear design that allows you to hear what's going on around you. If you do a lot of city walking, or use your earbuds somewhere that it's important to be aware of your surroundings, like while feeding lions at the zoo, then these are a great option.\n\nThese are our favorite workout headphones for running and biking\u2014any sport where you have to be aware of traffic but still want to listen to podcasts. They also fit under a helmet and have a decent 10-hour battery life.\n\nBest Prime Day Kitchen Deals\n\nPhotograph: Vitamix\n\nThe Vitamix 5200 is a staple on wedding registries, but, turns out, you can just buy them too. Like WIRED contributor Joe Ray, I was never really a blender person, but the Vitamix changed that. Whether you\u2019re blending smoothies, soups, or sauces, this mixer is powerful and durable. It's not cheap (even on sale), but it's worth it.\n\nIf you want a Vitamix, but don't want to shell out for the 5200, the Explorian is a good, cheaper alternative. This is the brand's entry-level blender, but it still has a powerful two-horsepower engine that will reduce the toughest nuts to a creamy paste.\n\nThe NutriBullet Smart Touch Blender comes with a 1,500-watt motor base with a 64-ounce pitcher. It features a locking lid with a spout and includes a tamper for pushing down ingredients while you blend. There's also a good selection of presets, like a pur\u00e9e setting, one for soups, one for frozen drinks, and one for smoothies.\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to save on counter space, the KitchenAid Artisan Mini is better suited to smaller kitchens and households. The full-size, 5-quart version is also on sale for $380 ($60 off).\n\nSous vide cooking is a great way to stop overcooking your food. It's a handy addition to any kitchen, and the Nano 3.0 is one of our favorite starter precision cookers.\n\nThis AeroGarden goes on sale all the time, but the price is right. WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe said it was super easy to use. Simply place the seed pods in their corresponding holes, keep the bottom filled up with water, and wait. Just keep in mind that the light is bright\u2014this model would not be ideal in a studio apartment. And it'll grow herbs like crazy, which is a blessing or a curse depending on how much dill you can use in a given week.\n\nPhotograph: Zojirushi\n\nZojirushi's rice cookers are a favorite at WIRED. The brand uses \u201cfuzzy logic technology\u201d with a microcomputer (hence the abbreviation \u201cmicom\u201d in the product name) to make tiny adjustments in heat placement, ensuring that your grains are perfectly done, with minimal effort and no burned or wet spots. We have seen this one dip slightly lower, but this is still a good deal.\n\nWe love Le Creuset's enameled cast iron dishes (the bread pan isn't on sale, but it's one of our favorites). This roasting pan is a good size for everything from chicken to a prime rib.\n\nPhotograph: Bee's Wrap\n\nPlastic wrap is annoying. Try these beeswax wraps instead. They're organic cotton and sustainably sourced beeswax (along with jojoba oil and tree resin), which makes them waterproof (just make sure to use cold water to rinse them; hot water could melt off the wax). See our Best Reuseable Products guide for more great options.\n\nThese are a WIRED favorite. They do everything a single-use Ziplock bag does but, of course, they don't need to be thrown out and are dishwasher-, freezer-, and microwave-safe. You can also use them to keep supplies like screws, crayons, and bobby pins organized.\n\nIn addition to Stasher, we also love Rezip reusable baggies. They're durable, freezer-safe, and easy to clean\u2014just stick them in the dishwasher. They're also much cheaper than Stasher if you want to dip your toes into reusables. This is the 5-piece set, but there are a bunch of other options discounted too.\n\nPhotograph: HydroJug\n\nThe HydroJug (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite water bottles. It's big and heavy, but it can be a useful tool if you're often unmotivated to fill smaller, scrawnier bottles. The sale price extends to a variety of colors.\n\nOn Prime Day a few years ago, I (Louryn) got a multipack of Flamin' Hot Cheetos, and I accidentally conditioned myself to crave them before bed. If you fall into the same trap, or you're a normal person and you just enjoy a spicy snack from time to time, this is a good and cheap way to restock. Use Subscribe and Save to get the lowest price (or pay the nominal difference of $2 more for a one-time shipment). You can always cancel Subscribe and Save shipments after your first order arrives.\n\nThis All-Clad set includes 10-inch and 12-inch frying pans, which is a nice combo for families or anyone who regularly needs larger pans. All-Clad's D3 stainless steel construction has a very even heat distribution and is pretty durable. Reviewer Scott Gilbertson has seen these warp after about 10 years, but so far it hasn't happened to his. You can find more All-Clad deals here.\n\nWe haven't been able to try 1Zpresso's hand grinder yet, but it gets high marks from espresso gurus around the web. It's over triple the price of our favorite hand grinder, the Hario Skerton Pro ($50), so there are certainly cheaper ways to grind, but the J-Max has always garnered high marks for its ability to deliver a very even fine grind.\n\nPhotograph: Ninja\n\nThe compact pick in our guide to the best air fryers, Ninja's Max XL is notable for its space-saving design, which leaves countertop space for other tasks such as prepping vegetables. The max crisp setting is perfect for making homemade fries with a nice amount of crunch, and you can even modify conventional oven recipes to work with the Ninja.\n\nThe trick-or-treaters are coming (or perhaps just the midnight munchies). In any case, Amazon has a bunch of candy on sale right now, with prices starting at $2. Who doesn't need a 24-pack of Nerd Ropes?\n\nThese are reviewer Louryn Strampe's favorite coffee mugs, and not just because they're a brilliant shade of pink. The cups' construction makes it appear like your drink is floating, and the 16-ounce capacity means more coffee down your gullet.\n\nPhotograph: Zwilling\n\nIf you have kids who touch everything dangerous in your kitchen, we recommend the double-walled Zwilling kettle in our Best Kettles guide. It comes with six presets, as well as a dedicated button for making baby formula.\n\nOnce our top pick for chef knives, the Victorinox is still a great knife. We really like the nearly nonstick finish\u2014hardly anything sticks to this blade, not even fresh cilantro. It's a great all-around kitchen knife and well worth grabbing at this price.\n\nBest Prime Day Coffee Deals\n\nBreville Barista Express Impress Espresso Machine Photograph: Breville\n\nWhat we love about the Breville Impress (6/10, WIRED Review) is that beginners can make good to very good espresso right out of the box. Breville has done a nice job of automating some of the trickier elements of espresso-making. The downside is that we found a good bit of variation from shot to shot.\n\nThe Barista Touch is a coffee shop in a machine. You get a built-in burr grinder, a hot water spout, and a digital display to control your brews. Tap the Latte button and the Touch will crank out a latte, even foaming the milk. The results are not as good as what you can do by hand, but it's a nice option if you're feeling lazy.\n\nThere are dozens of these milk frothers available on Amazon, from dozens of different spammy companies all selling more or less the same device. None of them are outstanding, but I bought one a few years ago and, surprisingly, it's still going. Use it to froth milk, or for what I do: mixing up matcha tea. Will this one last you years? I honestly don't know, but at least you're only out $8 if it doesn't.\n\nPhotograph: Fellow\n\nNothing beats the speed and convenience of an electric kettle for heating up water to a precise temperature. Stovetop kettles can't compete on any criteria. Plus, if you want to get into pour-over coffee, which many WIRED staffers heartily recommend, your kettle will need a gooseneck so that your pour is precise. The nearly identical EKG+ (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has a smooth pour and can hold its temperature for up to an hour before it auto shuts off, although the 2.5-foot cable could stand to be longer.\n\nWe go nuts for coffee here on WIRED's Gear Team, and the ingenious AeroPress is one of our favorite portable coffee makers. It makes a damn fine cup of brew. It also happens to be incredibly easy to use and clean up. This one will make 10 fluid ounces of coffee up to a time, which is about a diner mug's worth.\n\nBest Prime Day Mattress Deals\n\nHelix Midnight Luxe Hybrid Mattress Photograph: Helix\n\nEnter code DEALDAY25 at checkout to get this deal, which includes two pillows. This matches the best price we've seen our favorite mattress reach. The Midnight Luxe has six layers of foam and individually wrapped inner springs. It's medium-firm and comfortable for almost all sleeping positions. There are other firmness levels within the Luxe collection that we haven't tested yet.\n\nCasper's hybrid bed reaches its $1,495 price but is often $1,196 on Amazon. Still, this price is among the best deals we've tracked on a bed from the brand that put bed-in-a-box mattresses on the map. This hybrid is a great neutral option. Did you read our guide and have no idea which one to go with? Get this one. It strikes a good balance between soft and supportive, with just enough bounce.\n\nPhotograph: My Green Mattress\n\nEnter code DISCOVER at checkout to see this discount. We have seen this dip slightly lower in the past, but the base price has risen since then and this price is lower than recent sales. This is our top organic mattress pick for kids. It's made from certified organic cotton, wool, and latex.\n\nEnter code DISCOVER at checkout to apply this discount. If you aren't ready for a whole new mattress, spruce up your existing one with a mattress topper. This organic latex choice from My Green Mattress is our favorite firm topper\u2014it's 2 inches high, has a zipper if you need to remove the organic cotton cover from the pad, and stays in place nicely without needing any straps.\n\nBrooklinen Weighted Throw Blanket Photograph: Brooklinen\n\nThis price is for the terra-cotta color only. Brooklinen's weighted blanket is 12 pounds but feels sufficiently weighty. It's held up well through many trips in the wash and cat biscuit-making sessions. It's also prettier than some other options with one side having a nice texture pattern.\n\nWe like several Brooklinen sheets, and this is our favorite organic set. They're soft, but not overly silky and you shouldn't sleep too hot in them. They are made from Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)-certified organic cotton and are Oeko-Tex certified, which means they're tested for and do not contain any known toxic chemicals.\n\nThis amazing and gigantic blanket will be the focus of its own story in a few weeks' time. WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe loves it. True to its name, it's massive, measuring 10 feet by 10 feet, so it's really easy to share\u2014even if you're a blanket hog like she is. The price matches what we've seen during other shopping holidays.\n\nBest Prime Day Smart Home Deals\n\nPhotograph: Govee\n\nIn our Govee Buying Guide, we selected this as the best lamp. It has a modern design and support for Amazon Alexa as well as Google Assistant. You can select the lighting using your phone or the included remote. This price matches the lowest we have seen.\n\nTurn anything plugged into an outlet into a smart device with a smart plug. Our favorite mini smart plug from Kasa is on sale\u2014usually available for around $17, snagging these great plugs for $6 each is a steal. It's easy to control and create routines, and these bulbs work with Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Samsung SmartThings.\n\nPhilips Hue White and Color Ambiance Starter Kit Photograph: Amazon\n\nPhilips Hue's smart bulb starter kit isn't a cheap investment, and we usually only recommend it if you're looking for an upgraded kit. But it is a little cheaper right now to get three bulbs, a smart switch, and Philips' smart home hub, which you can use with older Philips bulbs and other third-party accessories. It's the lowest deal we've seen on this kit in months.\n\nThe Netgear Nighthawk series of routers are well regarded and make up some of the picks in our Best Routers guide. This model isn't one of the fancy ones, but it's a solid choice. You get Wi-Fi 6 support, coverage of up to 3,500 square feet, and the USB input means you can connect a storage drive for shared disk space.\n\nPhotograph: Newegg\n\nSitting at the top of our Best Wi-Fi Routers guide, this Wi-Fi 6 router is ideal for the average home seeking more reliable Wi-Fi on a budget. It has a slick, black finish with four antennas, performs reliably, and has four gigabit Ethernet LAN ports, a single gigabit WAN port, and a USB 3.0 port on the back. It is frequently discounted but hasn't been this low since Amazon's last Prime Day event.\n\nIf you're battling Wi-Fi dead zones in your house, you may need to add a mesh router to your setup. Our upgrade pick, Eero's Pro 6E (7/10, WIRED Recommends) makes this process as simple and hands-off as it can be, and each should one covers 2,000 square feet. The brand's subscription is pricey at $10 a month (the cheaper option was eliminated)\u2014you don't have to subscribe for it to work but there are nice features like parental controls. This older Eero router is on sale for $45 if you just need something cheap right now.\n\nSimpliSafe (9/10, WIRED Recommends) makes home security easy to set up and expand on as needed with multiple motion, door, and window sensors, plus panic buttons and key fob controllers. The brand has frequent sales\u2014and you've probably heard podcast ads with discount codes\u2014but we don't typically see it reach 50 percent off. We didn't like the indoor SimpliCam, but it has since been updated and we have yet to test the new one. Several other smaller bundles are also discounted between 40 and 50 percent off with different variations of accessories.\n\nPhotograph: Govee\n\nGovee makes some of our favorite smart lighting, and this is our pick for a diffused light strip that can be installed on the wall, stairs, or anywhere else in plain view. It comes with adhesive brackets, so you can make curved shapes like clouds. It supports countless effects in the Govee app and works with voice commands from Google Assistant or Alexa. Read our Best Govee Lights guide for more.\n\nMonster's digital frame isn't as good as options from Aura or Nixplay, which top our guide to the best digital frames, but we like it better than most other cheap frames. The 1280p screen gets you crisp photos and you can use Google Assistant or Alexa with it too. If you just can't imagine spending $150 or so on those other frames, this one works.\n\nIf you can spend more than the Monster above, we do prefer our top choices, but Skylight's 15-inch frame looks nice whether you put it on a shelf or wall mount it. There's a smaller 10-inch one if you want to spend less.\n\nEcoFlow River 2 Pro Portable Power Station Photograph: EcoFlow\n\nIt's debatable whether some of the Best Portable Power Stations are truly all that portable, but this one from EcoFlow is easy to carry, with a large handle along the back. The LiFeP04 battery inside is good for 768 watt-hours and perfect for keeping your gadgets charged up on camping trips. The main downside is fan noise.\n\nThe smaller version of this recently earned a spot in our Best Portable Chargers guide, and the larger model is our top pick of the Best Portable Power Stations, so the 1000 Plus is definitely worth a look. It packs a 1264Wh-capacity battery, loads of ports, three AC outlets, and is rated at 2,000 watts with a 4,000-watt peak power capability, which means you can plug in electric grills and other small appliances without worrying.\n\nTile Sticker Two-Pack Photograph: Tile\n\nIf you're constantly losing remotes, Tile's Stickers can come in handy. These Bluetooth tracker stickers can be stuck onto remotes, e-readers, or anything else you want to keep track of within a 150-foot range. This is the best price we've seen since last year.\n\nPetcube makes some of our favorite pet cameras, and this one holds more treats (1.5 pounds) and larger pieces (up to 1 inch in diameter) than some of the others we tried. The Bites 2 looks good and has an extensive four-microphone array that sounds great both ways. The Bites 2 Lite loses the laser and is made from plastic rather than aluminum, but it's significantly cheaper, typically at about $100. Right now it's discounted to $80.\n\nEven with the subscription ($3 per month or $30 per year), this video doorbell is one of the cheapest options around, and it made the honorable mentions section in our Best Video Doorbells guide. Video quality is 1080p with a limited field of view, and notifications aren't the fastest, but it performs reliably. If you don't want a subscription, consider buying it bundled with Sync Module 2 ($47), which is also half-price right now.\n\nNiu KQi3 Pro Photograph: Niu\n\nThis is our favorite electric scooter for most people. It goes on sale regularly, so never pay full price for one. The KQi3 has great range, going 18 to 20 miles for most people. It maxes out at 20 miles per hour, the 9.5-inch tubeless tires offer a comfy ride, and the disc brakes reliably bring it to a quick stop.\n\nEven after trying the newer Withings Body Comp smart scale, the Body+ model is still in the sweet spot for us. It tracks data about your health including body fat, muscle mass, and total body water, and can display charts of your progress over time.\n\nThis is an upgraded model of our favorite, the Body+ mentioned above. It adds extra features to keep an eye on your heart health, like its built-in heart monitor that can analyze your cardiovascular health using vascular age data. We found this wasn't totally worth the extra price on the more expensive Withings Body Comp scale, but the Body Cardio is cheaper normally, and even better on this sale.\n\nWater damage is one of the most frightening and potentially expensive disasters any homeowner can face, but if you learn about a leak swiftly enough you can keep damage to a minimum. This kit comes with four sensors and a hub and uses the relatively long-range LoRa standard to alert you the minute any of the sensors detects water. It is our pick for larger properties in our Best Water Leak Detectors guide.\n\nPhotograph: Aqara\n\nThis chunky doorbell offers 1080p video and a wide 162-degree field of view to help you monitor your front porch. It takes regular AA batteries (but can also be wired) and it comes with an indoor hub that can record video locally onto a microSD card, but also doubles as a Wi-Fi repeater and a chime. It has wide smart home compatibility, and can even be used with Apple's HomeKit Secure Video, which is what earned it a place in our Best Video Doorbells guide.\n\nIf you want to stay powered up on your travels, you need a travel adapter, and this one from Epicka is the budget pick in our Best Travel Adapters guide. It works in more than 150 countries and has four USB-A ports on the bottom, plus a 15-watt USB-C port on the side. It has dropped this low before, but not for a while.\n\nGet not one, not two, but four of our favorite smart bulbs for the best price we've seen all year. These smart bulbs are easy to use, beautifully vibrant, comes with a variety of present colors, and work with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n\nPhotograph: Nanoleaf\n\nWe love this light kit for adding fun ambient lighting to any room. Each hexagon is its own light, so you can control and customize the hexagons into just about any design of your choosing\u2014both in color schemes. and onto your wall. Just grab a level to make sure you put them on straight!\n\nThe Google Nest Hub Max has a nice big screen and slim, powerful speakers to match. It's our favorite smart display for a variety of reasons, from how nicely it doubles as a photo frame to how great it is as a kitchen assistant.\n\nBest Prime Day Home, Apparel, and Personal Care Deals\n\nTherabody Smart Goggles Photograph: Therabody\n\nTherabody's Smart Goggles (9/10, WIRED Recommends) use heat, vibrations, and light pressure to massage your eyes and temples. The app lets you customize sessions and track your heart rate to help reduce stress and anxiety. It feels amazing, but it's very expensive\u2014all Therabody products are\u2014and I noticed a small hole in the eye pad after a while. It hasn't gotten bigger, but it's worth noting. We're testing Gravity's competing eye massager right now. It's not app-controlled, but it's much cheaper and we don't hate it so far.\n\nThe TheraFace Pro is a very expensive self-care tool. We liked it, finding it exfoliated away blackheads, cleared up stuffy sinuses from allergies, and even minimized fine lines. But there are also buzzwordy functions that may or may not work, like microcurrent. It hasn't gone on sale often in its yearish shelf life so if you can afford to spend this much on a skincare device, it's a good time to grab it. Unfortunately, the hot and cold heads are an additional $99.\n\nWillow Go Wearable Breast Pump Photograph: Willow\n\nOur favorite wearable breast pump is easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to bring anywhere. What's not easy is the price tag you usually find on the Willow Go (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It's priced similarly to a standard portable pump right now, though, making it much more worth the splurge.\n\nIf you're shopping for baby gear, a good deal goes a long way with how much stuff you need before little one arrives. While insurance covers some of the cost of pumps, it's often not all of it. Depending on the insurance you have, this current deal on the Elvie Stride (7/10, WIRED Recommends) may get you closer to the price that your plan will cover.\n\nOur favorite stroller is all-around great: it comes with an adapter for infant car seats, has great suspension without being bulky, and folds down surprisingly close to flat. It's already a great deal for its regular price, and even more worth purchasing right now. We occasionally see it go a little lower than $300 on sale, but this is a great price to jump on.\n\nTushy Classic 3.0 Bidet Photograph: TUSHY\n\nA person once asked rhetorically: If you fell in the mud, would you reach for a sheet of toilet paper or a hose? They were talking about bidets, and put that way, it does seem to be a cleaner option. Certainly, it's gentler on your caboose. The Tushy is affordable and, as far as bidets go, easy to install on practically any toilet. There's no need for an electrical plug or a hot water hookup, which is why we gave it the recommendation as the best budget bidet that's non-electric.\n\nTrimming and edging the lines of a beard can be just as time-consuming and aggravating as edging a lawn. Most trimmers on the market make do with too many plastic guides of different lengths\u2014too many\u2014and yet not enough attachments for fine detailing. The Multigroom Series 9000 comes with an adjustable guide from 1 to 3 millimeters, plus a mini-foil shaver, narrow-width head, T-shaped head, ear/nose attachment, and more. Its stainless steel construction is a rarity among consumer-level trimmers, too, and feels solid in the hand, as if you're a semi-professional barber working magic rather than just a guy in a bathroom mirror.\n\nCoway Airmega 250 Air Purifier Photograph: Amazon\n\nFor larger rooms, you want a larger air purifier, and we recommend the Airmega 250 as the best air purifier for living rooms. Product reviewer Matt Jancer has been using one for years to keep the air inside his New York City apartment clean and pure. Filters tend to be expensive at $60 to 80, but he's gotten nearly a year out of each filter, so the performance-per-price is worth it, in his opinion. Its automatic functioning will kick the purifier into high gear if heavy pollution is detected, but normally it runs on a whisper-quiet low setting when needed. Even sitting a few feet away, Matt doesn't notice it.\n\nEnter code WOOF25 at checkout to see this discount. I get compliments on this Diggs carrier every time I bring my cats to the vet. It works for cats or smaller dogs and it feels high-end in its construction, with lots of pockets for you. There are safety features like seat belt clips and a buckle strap and it's also been crash-tested and gets a five-star rating by the Center for Pet Safety. The only thing I dislike is that you can't really see through the mesh to make sure your pet is OK, but the company says this is to give nervous pets some privacy and calmness.\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nA sunrise alarm wakes you up at you set time by gradually brightening and changing the color temperature, or the color spectrum, to mimic real sunlight. It's a gentler way to wake up than a blaring alarm. Like most sunrise alarms, the WiiM also has a sunset feature for winding down before bed. Of all the ones WIRED reviewer Matt Jancer tested, the WiiM was the easiest to set up and walk the user through its operation on the connected app.\n\nWIRED reviewer Matt Jancer has relied on the 35-pint model to keep his East Coast apartment habitable during sweltering, humid summers. You can set the desired humidity level in 5 percent increments from 35 to 85, and the automatic functioning will turn the machine on and off as needed. It's not particularly loud for a dehumidifier, and Jancer has to empty the water bin only once per day on his smaller model.\n\nAn electric fan is an ideal way to save a bit of money on air conditioning costs and to add a bit of pleasant white noise to boot. Unlike air conditioning, they take only a sip of electricity to run. WIRED reviewer Matt Jancer has been using the Vornado 460 for three summers and says its ability to move an impressive amount of air around a bedroom on the lowest setting belies its smallish size.\n\nPhotograph: Dyson\n\nThis has been on sale for $300 for a little while, but we still like this price. The Dyson Supersonic (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best hair dryers you can buy. It's also extremely expensive, so definitely buy it while it is on sale rather than paying full price.\n\nWe recommend this hair tool in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners. We have not seen it drop so low in price before. The flat iron is easy to use and comfortable to hold. We wish it had more temperature settings, but it's best for finer, wavier hair. If you want something simple that'll do the trick, and your hair isn't too textured, this is a solid option.\n\nThis multi-styling tool is also featured in our Best Hair Straighteners guide. It comes with round and paddle-brush attachments to get whatever look you're trying to achieve. The price is a match of the lowest we have tracked.\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nWIRED readers love LifeStraw filters, and this is the lowest we tend to see them drop in price. We include this product in our guide to the Best Home Emergency Gear. It removes 99 percent of waterborne bacteria and pathogens. At this price, you could pick one up for each member of the family.\n\nThis is very similar to a coat we recommended in our affordable cold-weather gear guide. Orolay coats consistently go viral because they're budget-friendly and warm. While we haven't tested this exact jacket, the reviews are positive and the price is right. Other coats from the brand are also on sale.\n\nA full review of this bed is coming, but the tl;dr is it's super comfy with a soft, machine-washable cover and it's big enough for adults to relax in. If you stare longingly at your pet as they snooze in their tiny beds, you might want to consider investing in your own. It's expensive though, so the $100 discount is welcome.\n\nPhotograph: Gravity\n\nThe Gravity Move (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite massage guns. It's compact but works sore muscles with ease. The Move comes with four attachment heads, including a heated one that feels heavenly. We just wish the case was bigger\u2014it only fits the device and one head at a time.\n\nNavigating the sheer amount of printer options available is exhausting. We don't have a full printer guide just yet, but after my last one died, I bought this one on the recommendation of a fellow WIRED reviewer and have been more than happy with the results. Prints and scans are good quality. It's also wireless and you can print from your phone too.\n\nYou've likely seen these candles floating around your feeds and they're great buys to treat yourself or to gift others. They're 13.5 ounces, smell good, and are hand-poured in the US. Also astrology is fun, whether you're actually into it or not\u2014according to the company, I, Nena, having been born on March 28, am reclusive by nature. Accurate!\n\nPhotograph: Loop\n\nI (Adrienne) have two pairs of these ear plugs, which are the Best for Sleep in our Best Earplugs guide. They are stylish, have different-sized ear tips, and stay put much more easily than the foam ones that you buy in a giant can. I like that they're reusable!\n\nThis handy tool has been steadily $25 for the last few months. It isn't a huge discount, but if you have pets, you need this. Roll it across your furniture to trap all the fur in its inner compartment, then just open it up and toss that fur in the trash. It works well and you don't have to worry about refilling sticky lint rollers.\n\nDog owners tend to know exactly the genetic makeup of their pups. Cat owners, not so much. Basepaws gives you a chance to learn more about your feline friends. We received PDF reports 70ish pages long detailing breed percentages and it states if they're a carrier or at risk of several health issues. Any pet can get sick at any time, but it's nice to know if you're up against something that you can maybe prevent.\n\nI (Adrienne) am currently running in these shoes, which have a wide toe box and are designed to switch easily between running on trails and roads. They're incredibly versatile.\n\nLast Prime Day, we were shocked to see that Amazon even carried one of our favorite recycled clothing brands. And lo, here we are, shocked again. This is the price we saw in July for some of the best recycled workout clothes.\n\nBest Prime Day Vacuum Deals\n\nDyson V15 Detect Cordless Stick Vacuum Photograph: Dyson\n\nThe V15 Detect holds the top spot in our Best Dyson Vacuums guide. At 7 pounds, it's lightweight, and Dyson has made it simple to convert into a handheld model. Since it's a Detect model, it also comes with a head that projects a green laser to help you spot microscopic dust\u2014making it easy to catch particles that are invisible to the naked eye.\n\nLupe's cordless vacuum (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best we tried and while it's cheaper than a Dyson, it's still very expensive even on sale. The cleaner head has a standard rotating brush and a composite foam roller, and when using its highest setting, that foam creates a strong seal against the ground. Most cordless vacs are best used in between really good cleanings with a more powerful upright vacuum, but the Lupe might be all you need. Unfortunately, it sounds terrible.\n\nThis is the best budget-friendly Dyson, and thanks to today's deal price, the vacuum is even more accessible. It can be converted into a hand vacuum and has a runtime of about 40 minutes. The included attachments will make it easier to get into the various nooks and crannies of your home.\n\nIn our guide to the Best Dyson Vacuums, we say this model is worthwhile if it's priced between $300 and $400. Well, well, well, would you look at that? Looks like the price is right. This is a solid pick for pet owners. It's similar to the Animal 3, but this model has a self-adjusting cleaner head that automatically raises and lowers the base plate to seal in suction on all floor types. There's also a motorized brush for added efficiency.\n\nPhotograph: Shark\n\nThe Shark AI Ultra 2-in-1 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite vac-mop combo in our Best Robot Vacuums guide. It vacuums well and does a thorough job of scrubbing the floors (using the included mopping bin) without getting the carpets wet. It also uses laser navigation to accurately map your home, allowing you to subdivide vacuuming and mopping zones within the easy-to-use app.\n\nThe Eufy X9 Pro (6/10, WIRED Review) doesn't work well as a stand-alone robot vacuum, but it's the best mopping vacuum we've tried. On the bottom of the X9 Pro are two mops that both rotate at about 180 revolutions per minute; it's both fast and accurate. WIRED senior associate reviews editor Adrienne So says it only took 30 minutes to mop her kitchen (including a spilled half-bottle of syrup without leaving the floor sticky), laundry room, and bathroom. The docking station dries the mops for you too, so they don't get gross.\n\nPhotograph: Roborock\n\nRoborock recently launched an upgrade to this model, our favorite robot vacuum and our current top pick. WIRED senior associate reviews editor Adrienne So says that, after several years, it's still the one vacuum she hasn't unplugged and consistently calls on to clean her house after other robot vacuums have failed.\n\nShark's AI Ultra 2-in-1 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has an amazing amount of functionality for the price compared to similar robot vac-mops out there, and that's before this sweet sale price. It uses laser navigation to map your home, and you can use an app to divide it into mopping and vacuuming areas depending on your flooring. The mopping is effective without getting your floors wet, too, and you won't need replacement bin bags. The price is specifically for the black and gold colorway, but the black and silver model is also on sale (though not as much as the gold version).\n\nBissell Little Green Machine Carpet Cleaner Photograph: Bissell\n\nThis is a match of the lowest price we tend to see for this little green machine. It made our list of the Best Carpet Cleaners and the Best Viral TikTok Gadgets. It's great for cleaning furniture, stairs, and vehicles.\n\nThis is the version of Samsung's stick vacuum that does not purport to use AI. The good news is that you probably don't really need machine learning in a vacuum, as I noted in my review (7/10, WIRED Review). This is a great vacuum if your midcentury modern home needs a vacuum to fit in with the stylish decor.\n\nRefresh your rugs with this smart carpet cleaner, which has a clever design and is fairly easy to maneuver. It is great at sucking grime out of your carpet, has a drying mode, and comes with attachments for upholstery. As the upgrade pick in our Best Carpet Cleaners guide, the relatively high price is our main criticism, so it's worth taking advantage of the discount. It does occasionally drop, but we have never seen it lower than this.\n\nIt can be a pain having to lug around a heavy carpet cleaner to deal with a spill or pet-related accident, so this portable, cordless cleaner from Bissell is handy. It is also mercifully easy to take apart and clean after you've dealt with the mess. It appears in our Best Carpet Cleaners guide as our favorite spot cleaner.\n\nBest Prime Day Lego and Other Toy Deals\n\nLego Marvel Hulkbuster Photograph: Amazon\n\nThis is not the enormous, 6,000-piece set for adults, but the version for kids. Still, commemorative theme sets tend to increase in value if you don't open them and hold them for a few years (if you can convince yourself to do that). It was $34 less when this sale first started.\n\nOne of the most gratifying parts of parenthood is realizing that your children are now fascinated by the same toys and characters that you loved when you were little. It never fails to blow my mind that my 6-year-old also knows who Optimus Prime is. This action figure transforms from a truck (very cool) into a robot (even cooler!) to save the Earth from the evil Decepticons. This would make a great holiday present.\n\nAdrienne's 6-year-old son has this playset, which they unfortunately paid full price for in a moment of weakness. It's incredibly sturdy and has lasted for several years while being stomped on and thrown into battle with other playsets. The Grimlock T-Rex motorcycle is obviously the coolest one, but siblings can share.\n\nYoto Player Photograph: Yoto\n\nKids will love this durable, portable speaker, as it can handle bedtime stories, music, and other content by slotting in cards. It also features a kid-friendly radio and a sleep mode. This appears in our Best Kids Speakers guide and is suitable for children from ages 3 to 12.\n\nIf you have a vase you love, but wish your flowers would last longer, LEGO has the answer for you. Build these artificial flowers that range from roses, poppies, daises and snapdragons to add to your favorite vessel.\n\nBehold this adorable stack of pancakes complete with a butter-and-syrup flower garnish. Have you ever seen a cuter Squishmallow? I highly doubt it. Tons of Squishmallows are on sale for Prime Day. Other options include a narwhal, hedgehog, mushroom, and possum. You can view them all here.\n\nMagna-Tiles are addicting for just about any kid, in the best kind of way. They're a STEM toy we're major fans of for a variety of ages. This set lets you build a road and cranes, so it's a great choice for any construction enthusiast or as an add-on to any current Magna-Tiles owners.\n\nFor a hazy few years, WIRED editor Adrienne So says her kids were obsessed with the Lego Ninjago series. (The show was originally commissioned as a limited run and then extended for its popularity.) This is a pretty reasonable price for a biggish 1,060-piece set that looks like a relatively simple build with a ton of minifigs.\n\nThis is a 4,049-piece set from the 2015 film Avengers: Age of Ultron, complete with three light-up arc reactors and compatibility with the Iron Man figure (sold separately).\n\nIf you're looking for a more interactive Lego set, look no further than the City Stuntz Ultimate Stunt Riders Challenge. It comes with a 360-degree loop, a ring of fire, an \u201calien tower\u201d vertical climb, a ramp, two toy motorcycles, and four Lego City minifigures. The three stunt challenges can be configured in a variety of different ways too. This is also the lowest price we've tracked for this Lego set, so far.\n\nBest Prime Day TV and Soundbar Deals\n\nSamsung The Frame Photograph: Walmart\n\nAnyone who cares about the aesthetics of their space probably doesn't want to stare at their TV screen all the time. That's where Samsung's The Frame comes in. This TV looks like a piece of art when not in use, helping it blend into the background of your well-curated space.\n\nThis quantum dot-enabled OLED is the brightest organic LED display that we've tested. It has shockingly bright colors to go with its great contrast. Small bezels also aid in a super immersive picture, making this one of the best TVs for brighter rooms.\n\nAmazon's Fire TVs are a solid and affordable way to get a quality screen for very little money. This 65-inch model has Dolby Vision support for good colors, and you can control it using your voice and Alexa.\n\nPhotograph: Hisense\n\nThe Hisense U8K is among the best-value TVs we've ever seen. It features a mini-LED display for ultra-bright colors and great contrast and is super easy to set up and use thanks to the onboard Google interface. Learn more in our full review (8/10, WIRED Recommends).\n\nHisense is a purveyor of quality mid-tier TVs, and this U7 is no exception. If you're after a larger screen to enjoy sports, the 144-Hz native refresh rate makes games (both real and virtual) look smooth as silk. I also like that it supports the latest high dynamic range codecs, so you'll get the brightest, most vibrant colors possible.\n\nIf you need a super large screen and you don't have a ton of cash lying around, this option from TCL is solid. It has support for the latest high dynamic range codecs like Dolby Vision for great colors, and the built-in Fire TV interface features essentially any app you want. It's not the brightest or prettiest TV ever, but it is big and has bold color.\n\nNanoleaf's 4D Kit (9/10, WIRED Recommends) can turn any movie or video game into a beautiful, immersive experience. The kit comes with both a trimmable light strip that fits TVs as large as 65 inches, and Nanoleaf's 4D camera that captures the TV screen's colors and projects them onto the wall behind the TV. The larger size is on sale, too, if your TV is between 65 and 85 inches.\n\nPhotograph: JBL\n\nThe JBL Bar 1300X (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with detachable wireless speakers. You can pop off the two speakers on the side of the main soundbar and place them wherever you'd like without having to worry about whether there are power outlets nearby or having to hide cables. It also has some of the best Dolby Atmos immersion we've heard from a soundbar at this price. The only downside is that, without cables, you'll have to charge the speakers between uses.\n\nYamaha's SR-C20A is our favorite affordable soundbar. It's affordable to tack onto even a very modest TV budget and its 100-watt forward-facing drivers can easily outperform the speakers on most TVs.\n\nWe're fans of nearly everything Roku offers and that includes this Streambar, which allows you to upgrade your sound and your streaming with one device. It's small enough that it's ideal for homes where space is at a premium, but still sounds good.\n\nPhotograph: TCL\n\nThis is our favorite TV to recommend for most people. The mid-tier model (7/10, WIRED Recommends) comes equipped with quantum dot technology and support for every high dynamic range (HDR) format for stunning colors. There's a game mode too, which uses software that can upscale 1080p to 120 frames per second. It's worth noting that, unlike older models, this one comes with Google TV instead of Roku. This is also the lowest price we've tracked, so far.\n\nWIRED reviewer Jaina Grey has spent a few years with this very large dual-subwoofer soundbar system from Japan. The two huge subwoofers deliver earth-shattering bass, while the two side speakers and rear speakers provide more lifelike reproduction than soundbars that bounce sound off the walls for side and rear noises. It also comes with support for all major object-based surround formats (like DTS:X and Dolby Atmos). It's great for large spaces, where the extra bass response helps things feel more cinematic. This is also the lowest price we've tracked, so far.\n\nFor the luxury-minded, this extravagant soundbar from Sennheiser is our top pick. It has massive speakers with some of the best audio quality we've seen (or heard, I suppose) of any soundbar we've tested. It's also one of the most expensive we recommend, but its price very rarely dips this low, so if you've been waiting for the perfect sale to grab one, now's the time.\n\nIf you're the type to set up smart speakers and gadgets throughout your home, this soundbar from Yamaha lets you cut down on some of that work. It comes with Amazon Alexa built in, and can control a host of other smart home gadgets. We've actually seen this soundbar's price fluctuate a fair amount recently, sometimes as low as $180, but this is still nearly the cheapest we've ever seen it, so it's a good time to grab one.\n\nBest Prime Day Camera Deals\n\nGoPro Hero10 Photograph: GoPro\n\nGoPro recently dropped the price of the Hero10 Black (8/10, WIRED Recommends) to $249, which makes it one of the cheapest action cameras on the market. It's two generations old, but still a very capable camera. This deal nets you an extra battery, case, small tripod, and other accessories. Check out our Best Action Cameras guide for more buying advice.\n\nAn upgrade over our Canon top pick in our mirrorless camera guide, the R5 features a 45-megapixel full-frame CMOS Sensor, staggeringly fast autofocus, excellent subject tracking in continuous AF mode, and dual memory card slots. It isn't cheap, but this is a pro-level beast of a camera. Note that the deal is on the body only; the lenses are sold separately.\n\nWe've seen this deal a couple of times in the past month, but it's still a good one. Sony's A7 III has been superseded by the A7 IV, but it's still a very nice camera. The 24.2-megapixel sensor has fantastic dynamic range and the decently fast phase-detection autofocus means you won't miss those key shots.\n\nPhotograph: Lexar\n\nI swear by these cards. I have been using them for seven years now without issue (back then they were much more expensive). They're fast enough for every camera that I've ever tested for WIRED, and I've never had any issue with them after years of life being tossed around in various camera bags.\n\nI remain puzzled as to why CFexpress cards are so dang expensive, but they are and if your camera uses them (and most modern, high-end video cameras do) this is about as good of a deal as we've ever seen.\n\nSanDisk 2-TB Extreme Portable SSD Photograph: Amazon\n\nOur favorite speedy portable SSD, the SanDisk is lightweight, with IP22-rated enclosures so it'll stand up to life on the go. I have been using this drive to make weekly backups for almost two years now and have had no issues. That said, our friends at Ars Technica, and other users around the web, have noted extremely high failure rates with this drive, mainly with the 2- and 4-TB versions. SanDisk has issued a firmware update, which seems to fix the problem.\n\nSamsung's T7 external solid-state drives are among the WIRED gear team's favorites. Lightning fast and reliable, solid-state drives take less babying than hard drives. The T7 Shield comes with a rubberized exterior to protect it from drops and impacts, and it's also IP65 water- and dust-resistant. It comes with a USB-C cable, fits in the palm of your hand, and doesn't require an external power source. Product reviewer Matt Jancer has been using several T7s and T7 Shields for three years and has never had even a hiccup. Other capacities are also on sale.\n\nCanon SELPHY QX10 Portable Square Photo Printer Photograph: Amazon\n\nSeveral WIRED staffers love this little printer that outputs perfectly-sized, small-but-not too-small, Polaroid-like images. Though technically it costs $150, this printer has been hovering at $129 lately, but $78 is still a solid deal. This price is for the black but the other colors are discounted to $99. The larger Canon SELPHY CP1500 printer we tried is also on sale for $99. That's also a solid price, but not uncommon.\n\nTravel and Outdoor Deals\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nI (Matt Jancer) have wheeled, lifted, and slung around a lot of budget bags over dozens of trips across the globe, and the Maxlite is the one I recommend as the best budget suitcase. It's lightweight at 5.4 pounds, reasonably well made compared to the competition, and stands up to the cargo bellies of aircraft without anything more than scuff marks. For a carry-on, the two-wheel rollaboard is my preference, since it offers more interior space than a four-wheel spinner.\n\nHydro Flask routinely make some of our favorite insulated water bottles. Most insulated travel mugs these days can keep ice water cold and hot coffee warm. What makes Hydro Flask stand out is the durability of their powder coating. I've (Matt Jancer) knocked several around for years in gyms, at the base of rock climbing walls outdoors, and rolling around the floorboards of my old car and have never managed to scratch or dent one yet.\n\nThis electric bike has good looks, strong acceleration, and a better price point than the competition, especially right now with the major sale Wing is having. It's got a built-in headlight and taillight, comfortable hand grips, and a nicer seat than you'd expect. It checks a lot of boxes at its higher price point, so this is a great time to jump on this deal.\n\nWhen Is Amazon Prime Big Deal Days?\n\nAmazon's second big sale event runs from Tuesday, October 10 through Wednesday, October 11, 2023. It ends at 2:59 am ET on October 11 (11:59 pm PT).\n\nWill You Need a Prime Membership?\n\nYes, this event is for Amazon Prime members, meaning most of these Prime Day deals are for subscribers only. If you want to take the ride you need to buy the ticket. In this case, the ticket is $15 a month, and you get free two-day shipping. There are a whole bunch of other Prime Day perks you can take advantage of as well. You can also sign up for a 30-day Amazon Prime trial. Just register before the event and cancel right when the trial ends so you can take advantage of these deals. That said, there are a lot of discounted products available to folks who are not Prime subscribers. Retailers like Best Buy and Walmart are also price-matching some items or throwing their own competing sales.\n\nWhat Are Invite-Only Deals?\n\nDuring Prime Day this past summer, Amazon introduced invite-only deals\u2014a system to help make it easier for Prime members to access deals that are expected to sell out quickly\u2014and the company brought it back for Prime Big Deal Days. The feature is only available on select products but it has spread across a variety of categories and price points.\n\nIf a specific product is part of the Invite-Only Deals system, you'll see a \u201cRequest Invite\u201d button on the right-hand side. All you have to do is click it for a chance to buy the product at that sale price. However, it's important to note that there's no guarantee you'll receive the invite. You can learn more about the program and how it works in our story on How to Shop Like a Pro During Amazon Prime Day.\n\nWhen is Prime Day (Prime Big Deal Days)?\n\nThe second and presumably final Amazon Prime Day 2023 is happening right about.... now. Prime Day deals started flowing at 3 am EST on October 10 and will continue through October 11.\n\nHow to find the best Prime Big Deal Days deals?\n\nWIRED is the only publication posting about Amazon Prime Day. Wait, sorry, looks a handful of other sites are, too. But you should only read WIRED, because we actually vet every deal and compare it to the actual street price instead of an absurd MSRP that you will never observe in the wild. Also, we review the products we recommend and don't just send you Prime Day deals on junk that will break. It's only a deal if you need it and it's good!\n\nAre other retailers running sales?\n\nAmazon Prime Day has inspired many imitators and you'll find sales from competitors like Best Buy, Target, and the like. Some of these sales are great, and we'll flag when they are, but others are worth holding off on until Black Friday and Cyber Monday, when WIRED will again be the Internet's only website with deals posts.\n\nRetailer Sale Pages"

        "body": "Amazon Prime Day Part II is here, and that means a fresh batch of Prime Day deals. Technically Amazon calls this Prime Big Deal Days, but like most people, we think of it as Prime Day Deux. As usual, most of these Prime Day deals require a Prime membership, but you can snag a 30-day free trial to make the most of the event. We've been combing Amazon's website to bring you the best discounts on laptops, tablets, kitchen and home gear, headphones, and plenty more.\n\nWe test products year-round and handpicked these deals. Products that are sold out or no longer discounted as of publishing will be crossed out. We'll update this guide regularly throughout Prime Day by adding fresh deals and removing dead deals.\n\nWIRED Featured Deals\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\nBest Prime Day Amazon Device Deals\n\nThe discount will apply automatically during checkout once you meet the $40 order threshold on select products. Amazon-branded products range from home essentials like paper towels and batteries to snacks, office supplies, over-the-counter medicines, and more. This deal is an easy way to stock up on frequently-used items for cheap.\n\nGift card deals are only worthwhile if you'd be spending the money anyway. With brands like Doordash, Instacart, Fandango, and more featured in this sale, chances are you can find a worthy discount. Each card has a unique coupon code listed on the product page. Enter it during checkout to save.\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nAmazon devices are almost always going on sale, but this is an especially nice deal since it comes with a free smart plug that typically sells for about $20. It isn't the same exact model, but a similar Kasa plug is the top pick in our Best Smart Plugs guide. The Echo Dot (5th Gen) is one of our favorite Alexa speakers. You can use the included smart plug to do things like ask Alexa to turn off your box fan or turn on a lamp.\n\nAmazon has a bunch of private-label clearance on sale for up to 55 percent off. Want D-cell batteries for $5? Here you go. How about compostable plates for $8? Giant crayons for $9? A truly hideous fanny pack for $12? The point is, there are 10 pages full of random items to choose from, and all of them are cheap. Go wild.\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nOther Echo Show devices are also on sale, but the Echo Show 8 is our favorite. This product comes with a free trial of Alexa Together, an Amazon service that aims to replicate the tasks of a caregiver. It usually costs $20 per month. Set a reminder to cancel it if you aren't interested in subsequent charges.\n\nThe Echo Studio is the best-sounding Alexa speaker, but it's also pretty expensive. This price matches a low we've seen just once before. It has more powerful sound in general, but the changes are especially noticeable on the low end. Check out our Best Smart Speakers guide for additional details and recommendations.\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nThis matches the price we saw in July for the best Kindle for kids. It's waterproof and has adjustable warm lighting for reading at night. If your kid is really into the Warrior Cats books, there is a special edition just for them for $120. The standard Kindle Kids is also on sale and it's a bit cheaper at $80 ($40 off), but it lacks the adjustable warm lighting and waterproofing. Whichever you get, Amazon throws in a protective case, a one-year subscription to Amazon Kids+, and a two-year no-questions-asked replacement guarantee.\n\nThe other Kindles are more affordable, so there's no practical reason to spend the cash for the Oasis. But if you're like me and love physical page-turn buttons, you may want to consider this one. We think it's probably due for an update soon though.\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nIf you like to take digital notes, the Kindle Scribe (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the first of Amazon's e-readers that lets you write on the enormous 10.2-inch screen like a regular notebook. However, if you want to write in the margins of books, you'll have to settle for using sticky notes. That's frustrating given the point of spending this kind of money is to write on it (marking up books is better on the Kobo Elipsa).\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nThe Fire Max 11 (5/10, WIRED Review) is Amazon's biggest, nicest, and most overpriced Fire tablet. This deal makes it much more palatable. The display and new fingerprint sensor are nice, as is the ability to use the keyboard without resorting to Bluetooth, but the Fire OS operating system leaves much to be desired (like a decent app store). Still, if you're set on a Fire tablet and you want a big display, this isn't a bad deal.\n\nBest Prime Day Laptop and Accessory Deals\n\nMacBook Air Photograph: Apple\n\nThe 2023 MacBook Air (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite laptops this year. It has an excellent six-speaker sound system, a 1080p front-facing webcam, and a 10-core variant of the M2 processor the previous year's model came with. It's blazingly fast for most normal work and can even handle some light video editing and other heavier tasks.\n\nThis is last year's 13-inch MacBook Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) with the M2 chip and Touch Bar. It has the same processor that's in the new MacBook Air (our top pick for most people) and doesn't offer any major hardware upgrades except for a fan, which allows the processor to get a little warmer and eke out more power over a longer period of time. This helps if you\u2019re working on pro-level tasks like video editing but can\u2019t spend the premium that Apple charges for its bigger Pro models.\n\nThe Razer Blade 14 earned an 8/10, WIRED Recommends award in our review. It has a gorgeous 16:10 display, plenty of USB ports, a full-size HDMI output, and an Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti, with the option to upgrade to the 40-series, giving it plenty of power to tear through the toughest games. It's the laptop WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft used through Starfield's launch weekend; it has proven its worth already.\n\nPhotograph: Das Keyboard\n\nYou may have to click on \u201cSee More Buying Options\u201d to see this deal. The Das Keyboard MacTigr pairs well with Apple's laptops and PCs. It has a dedicated Mac layout, Cherry MX Red switches, a two-port USB-C hub, and a high-quality, all-metal build. It rarely goes on sale.\n\nThis is our favorite external keyboard in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. It's a great option if you're a fan of the Magic Keyboard and are looking to fully replicate your MacBook setup. However, this version is fairly bare-bones\u2014it doesn't come with a Touch ID button or the same function row keys as the M-series MacBooks (that model isn't on sale, sadly). But it does come with the standard keys like playback controls, a Mission Control key, as well as a number pad. This is also the lowest price we've tracked for this keyboard, so far.\n\nThe Studio Display (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has a spacious 27-inch display that's perfect for juggling multiple apps at the same time and a 5K resolution that's stunningly sharp (there's no HDR though, so colors look slightly more contrasty and saturated compared to the neutral tones on Apple's Pro Display XDR). Although it's pricey, this is an excellent monitor for those who want a really accurate and sharp screen. Equipped with a 12-megapixel camera, along with built-in mics and speakers, it's ideal for video calls too. This is also the lowest price we've tracked, yet.\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nOne of our top picks from our building your own PC guide, AMD's 16-core behemoth is a killer CPU for high-end 4K or 144-Hz gaming. It has some special requirements. It gets so hot there's no way you should put it into a PC without a liquid cooler like the Asus ROG Ryujin II Liquid Cooler.\n\nPlugable's USB-C Triple Display Docking Station is a great choice, especially for anyone using more than one monitor. It supports up to three displays at once (either HDMI or DisplayPort for each). The dock also packs six USB 3.0 ports (two on the front, four in the back) and a gigabit Ethernet port. Whenever you come back to your workstation with your MacBook, all you have to do is plug it in and you instantly have a multi-monitor setup. With an output of up to 60 watts, you can use the dock to charge your laptop too.\n\nClaiming the top spot in our Best USB Flash Drives guide, the SanDisk Extreme Pro balances speed, reliability, and price. The sleek aluminum case has a loop for attaching it to a keyring and a slider to push out the USB-A plug. It is fast, performs reliably (we've been using one regularly for two years), and comes with a lifetime warranty.\n\nBest Prime Day Tablet Deals\n\nPhotograph: OnePlus\n\nThe OnePlus Pad (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the few Android tablets we think is a worthy iPad alternative. It offers good performance, has great battery life, and an excellent 144-Hz, 11.6-inch LCD display. We strongly recommend OnePlus\u2019 magnetic keyboard, which is also on sale for $100 ($50 off), however, if you purchase directly from the company's website, you can get the keyboard bundled for free.\n\nThe 9th-gen iPad (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite iPad for most people, even though it's one generation behind. Aside from costing less than the current 10th-gen model, it is still compatible with the same accessories as the first-gen Apple Pencil. It retains the physical Home button with Touch ID at the bottom of the screen.\n\nPixel Tablet Photograph: Google\n\nGoogle's Pixel Tablet (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is part tablet, part smart display. It comes with a charging dock that doubles as a speaker, so you can pump out the tunes and get answers from Google Assistant at a moment's notice. Take it off the charger and you get a full Android tablet experience.\n\nBest Prime Day Watch Deals\n\nPhotograph: Apple\n\nThe 2nd-generation Apple Watch SE is our top pick for most people. It's the most affordable of what Apple touts as its first carbon-neutral products (when bought in conjunction with the new sport loop, that is). It's compatible with WatchOS 10, which is where many new health and wellness features show up.\n\nThe second-generation Garmin Epix Pro holds the title of Best Outdoor Watch in our Best Fitness Trackers guide and is one of our favorite sports watches (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It has a bright AMOLED display, battery life that can last through a week of camping, and useful features like redshift mode (for training outside at night), and a flashlight. There's also an endurance feature, in addition to all the other Garmin proprietary metrics that assess what kind of shape you're in. This deal applies to the 51-mm size, but the 42-mm and 47-mm sizes are also on sale.\n\nWe liked (but didn't love) the Withings Move smartwatch when we tried it. One of our chief complaints was its lack of heart rate monitoring, but that's an issue the Withings Steel HR has resolved, adding this crucial feature to what was already an elegant, subtle smartwatch. It has typical analog watch hands, with a smaller monochrome display for basic data, and it won't buzz your wrist all day with every single notification.\n\nGot an Android phone? We really liked using the TicWatch Pro 5, mostly because its battery stands out among competitors like Google, Samsung, and Apple. We easily get three days of average use, and Mobvoi\u2019s unique dual-display technology lets you stretch the battery life even further. It\u2019s powered by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon W5+ Gen 1 chipset, which is a newer and more efficient processor. And we've barely seen any hiccups operating this Wear OS 3 watch.\n\nBest Prime Day Phone Deals\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 Photograph: Samsung\n\nSamsung's new Galaxy Z Flip5 (7/10 WIRED Recommends) delivers a larger cover screen, which means you can do more on the phone without having to open it up. If you or someone you know always complain about how big phones are these days, a folding flip phone might be the answer to those woes. If you want to try a different style of flip phone, the Motorola Razr+ is also on sale for $800 ($100 off).\n\nPhotograph: Samsung\n\nDon't want to pay much for a phone? This is one of the best you'll find for the price (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It lacks wireless charging (see the Pixel 7A below if you really want it), but the AMOLED screen has a 120-Hz screen refresh rate, the performance is decent, and the cameras are reliable. The battery also lasts more than a day.\n\nGoogle Pixel 7A Photograph: Google\n\nThis is our favorite smartphone for most people (8/10, WIRED Recommends), and this is an incredible price (and the lowest we have tracked). It has smooth performance, a nice bright screen, excellent cameras, and even features like wireless charging. The battery life is just OK.\n\nWe have a lot of other good cheap phone recommendations here, but this Motorola is fine and performs well for the money. It will only get one OS update (to Android 14), but it will get three years of security updates. It comes with an NFC sensor so you can make contactless payments, a headphone jack, and a microSD card slot. Read our Best Motorola Phones guide for more.\n\nOnePlus 11 Photograph: OnePlus\n\nThe OnePlus 11 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is fast. The performance is fast, the recharging is fast. It even looks fast. It has a bright, 120-Hz AMOLED screen, great speakers, and surprisingly good battery life for all that. Our main gripe is the IP64 water- and dust-resistance rating, which is not nearly as good as other flagship phones.\n\nUgreen's charger is, as the name suggests, a 145-watt charger with a 25,000-mAh battery. It's surprisingly compact for the power it provides, although at 1.1 pounds, it's definitely not ultralight. There are two USB-C ports and one USB-A port. What sets the Ugreen apart is that you can actually draw 145 watts while charging. That works out to one USB-C port at 100W and the other at 45W. Very few other batteries we've tested are capable of that feat.\n\nPhotograph: Anker\n\nThe Anker Nano is one of our favorite portable power banks, particularly for phones. It clicks right into the bottom of your device, and even comes in fun colors. This model has a 12-watt Lightning connector but there is a 22.5-watt USB-C version for the iPhone 15 or Android phones for $22 ($10 off). Both connectors fold away when you aren't using them. If you use a particularly thick case, this may not work. You'll likely be able to charge most phones fully once before needing to recharge the power bank itself via the included USB-C cable.\n\nWe are big fans of the Backbone One (8/10, WIRED recommends) and it appears in our Best Mobile Game Controllers guide. It slides open to cradle your phone and is very responsive, with buttons and bumpers that feel nice and clicky. The USB-C version that is on sale will work with most Android phones and the new iPhone 15 range.\n\nThis 2-in-1 charger is featured in our guide to the Best MagSafe Accessories. The price matches the lowest we have tracked. It doesn't have a built-in Apple Watch charger, but it can top off your compatible wireless earbuds whilst simultaneously charging your iPhone. It charges at the maximum 15-watt rate, and you can turn your iPhone sideways for iOS 17\u2019s new StandBy mode, converting it into a bedside alarm clock.\n\nAnker 3-in-1 MagSafe Wireless Charging Dock Photograph: Anker\n\nAnker makes our favorite lists often, including with this super compact 3-in-1 wireless charger. A MagSafe pad charges iPhones up to 15 watts at a slanted angle, and on the side is a standard Apple Watch puck (no fast-charging support). In the space inside the triangle is where you can place your AirPods Pro (or any other wireless earbuds case) to top them up.\n\nThis 2.5-inch cube from Anker is a great compact charger. It comes with a MagSafe pad on top (that charges at up to 15 watts), a top section that hinges to a 60-degree angle to reveal a charging surface for your AirPods, and a shelf on the side that has a built-in Apple Watch charger (which can comfortably accommodate any Apple Watch including the Ultra). You'll also get a 5-foot cable and a 30-watt charger in the box. It supports fast charging too.\n\nAnker 737 Power Bank Photograph: Anker\n\nWe just added this power bank as our top upgrade pick in our guide to the Best Portable Chargers. It's pricey, but today's deal makes it more accessible. It charges from zero to completely full in an hour and boasts a whopping 24,000-mAh capacity. And it's powerful enough to charge laptops and tablets as well as phones and other gadgets. There's even a built-in display to monitor stats like temperature and remaining battery percentage.\n\nThis heavy metal brick is a good option for charging laptops and smaller gadgets. It packs 20,000 mAh and supports a wide variety of fast charging standards. There is one USB-C PD port rated at 65 watts, two USB-A QC ports at 30 watts apiece, and a micro-USB input (though you are best using the USB-C to recharge it). We haven't seen it go on sale very often.\n\nThis travel kit from ESR works well if you want something that can prop your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation. It can also display your Apple Watch in Nightstand mode, so you can peek and see how long before you must get out of bed. The main body folds open with a MagSafe charging pad for your iPhone and a slot behind for your AirPods. We have seen this dip a little lower, but this is still a solid deal.\n\nThe unusual design of Satechi's fold-up wireless charging stand allows it to charge both phones and a wireless earbuds case (if it supports Qi wireless charging), plus a USB-C port to plug in a third device\u2014not bad for a device that fits in your bag. It has a 10,000-mAh capacity with LEDs to show how much juice is left. The downside is that it is slow, offering up to 10 watts of wireless charging power for phones (7.5 watts for iPhones), 5 watts for earbuds, and 10 watts from the USB-C port.\n\nBest Prime Day Headphone Deals\n\nPhotograph: Sony\n\nWhile its predecessor was one of the best pairs of wireless earbuds around, the WF-1000XM5 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is still no slouch. They produce balanced sound, are comfortable to wear, and have active noise cancellation. When using the ANC, they last up to eight hours on a single charge, stretching to around 12 hours without it.\n\nThis deal is a match of historic low pricing that we don't see come around very often. The Google Pixel Buds Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are truly excellent earbuds\u2014particularly if you have an Android phone. They're comfortable and available in a wide array of colors at this price.\n\nThis is an invite-only deal (read more about that below). The Jabra Elite 7 Active top the list of our favorite workout earbuds. They came out in 2021, but are still the smallest, with the teeniest case, and the most comfortable we've tried. The rubber tip kept these securely in our ears while running, even while under a beanie that was rubbing against them. You can customize the level of ambient noise you let in via the Sound+ app, and they're IP57-rated to withstand sweat. You'll get 8 hours of battery life and up to 30 hours in the case.\n\nPhotograph: Apple\n\nIf you have an iPhone, these are the best earbuds. The newer USB-C model (8/10, WIRED Recommends), has redesigned audio infrastructure, and remains to have some of the best noise canceling and microphones we've heard on a pair of earbuds.\n\nAnker's Space A40 earbuds (8/10, WIRED Recommends) are packed with features for the price, with noise canceling, wireless charging, and 10 hours of battery life. Plus, they sound good, are lightweight, and comfortable to wear, which is why our reviewers say they nearly give Apple's AirPods a run for their money. Anker's Liberty 4 NC earbuds (8/10, WIRED Recommends) are another feature-packed pair of buds with great noise canceling, and are on sale for $80 ($20 off).\n\nThe Beats Studio Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) were released just a couple of months ago. We wish the battery life was longer and that the controls and EQ options were more robust. But this price makes them more worthwhile, and they do have excellent noise canceling.\n\nPhotograph: Bose\n\nThese noise-cancelling headphones are our favorite for the office. With advanced signal processing and four microphones built in, these will limit any sound around you, making them great for focusing on work in a busy environment and for Zoom calls. These often fluctuate in price, but we think it's a great deal.\n\nWe like Sony's standard LinkBuds (8/10, WIRED Recommends) for the open-ear design that allows you to hear what's going on around you. If you do a lot of city walking, or use your earbuds somewhere that it's important to be aware of your surroundings, like while feeding lions at the zoo, then these are a great option.\n\nThese are our favorite workout headphones for running and biking\u2014any sport where you have to be aware of traffic but still want to listen to podcasts. They also fit under a helmet and have a decent 10-hour battery life.\n\nBest Prime Day Kitchen Deals\n\nPhotograph: Vitamix\n\nThe Vitamix 5200 is a staple on wedding registries, but, turns out, you can just buy them too. Like WIRED contributor Joe Ray, I was never really a blender person, but the Vitamix changed that. Whether you\u2019re blending smoothies, soups, or sauces, this mixer is powerful and durable. It's not cheap (even on sale), but it's worth it.\n\nIf you want a Vitamix, but don't want to shell out for the 5200, the Explorian is a good, cheaper alternative. This is the brand's entry-level blender, but it still has a powerful two-horsepower engine that will reduce the toughest nuts to a creamy paste.\n\nThe NutriBullet Smart Touch Blender comes with a 1,500-watt motor base with a 64-ounce pitcher. It features a locking lid with a spout and includes a tamper for pushing down ingredients while you blend. There's also a good selection of presets, like a pur\u00e9e setting, one for soups, one for frozen drinks, and one for smoothies.\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to save on counter space, the KitchenAid Artisan Mini is better suited to smaller kitchens and households. The full-size, 5-quart version is also on sale for $380 ($60 off).\n\nSous vide cooking is a great way to stop overcooking your food. It's a handy addition to any kitchen, and the Nano 3.0 is one of our favorite starter precision cookers.\n\nThis AeroGarden goes on sale all the time, but the price is right. WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe said it was super easy to use. Simply place the seed pods in their corresponding holes, keep the bottom filled up with water, and wait. Just keep in mind that the light is bright\u2014this model would not be ideal in a studio apartment. And it'll grow herbs like crazy, which is a blessing or a curse depending on how much dill you can use in a given week.\n\nPhotograph: Zojirushi\n\nZojirushi's rice cookers are a favorite at WIRED. The brand uses \u201cfuzzy logic technology\u201d with a microcomputer (hence the abbreviation \u201cmicom\u201d in the product name) to make tiny adjustments in heat placement, ensuring that your grains are perfectly done, with minimal effort and no burned or wet spots. We have seen this one dip slightly lower, but this is still a good deal.\n\nWe love Le Creuset's enameled cast iron dishes (the bread pan isn't on sale, but it's one of our favorites). This roasting pan is a good size for everything from chicken to a prime rib.\n\nPhotograph: Bee's Wrap\n\nPlastic wrap is annoying. Try these beeswax wraps instead. They're organic cotton and sustainably sourced beeswax (along with jojoba oil and tree resin), which makes them waterproof (just make sure to use cold water to rinse them; hot water could melt off the wax). See our Best Reuseable Products guide for more great options.\n\nThese are a WIRED favorite. They do everything a single-use Ziplock bag does but, of course, they don't need to be thrown out and are dishwasher-, freezer-, and microwave-safe. You can also use them to keep supplies like screws, crayons, and bobby pins organized.\n\nIn addition to Stasher, we also love Rezip reusable baggies. They're durable, freezer-safe, and easy to clean\u2014just stick them in the dishwasher. They're also much cheaper than Stasher if you want to dip your toes into reusables. This is the 5-piece set, but there are a bunch of other options discounted too.\n\nPhotograph: HydroJug\n\nThe HydroJug (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite water bottles. It's big and heavy, but it can be a useful tool if you're often unmotivated to fill smaller, scrawnier bottles. The sale price extends to a variety of colors.\n\nOn Prime Day a few years ago, I (Louryn) got a multipack of Flamin' Hot Cheetos, and I accidentally conditioned myself to crave them before bed. If you fall into the same trap, or you're a normal person and you just enjoy a spicy snack from time to time, this is a good and cheap way to restock. Use Subscribe and Save to get the lowest price (or pay the nominal difference of $2 more for a one-time shipment). You can always cancel Subscribe and Save shipments after your first order arrives.\n\nThis All-Clad set includes 10-inch and 12-inch frying pans, which is a nice combo for families or anyone who regularly needs larger pans. All-Clad's D3 stainless steel construction has a very even heat distribution and is pretty durable. Reviewer Scott Gilbertson has seen these warp after about 10 years, but so far it hasn't happened to his. You can find more All-Clad deals here.\n\nWe haven't been able to try 1Zpresso's hand grinder yet, but it gets high marks from espresso gurus around the web. It's over triple the price of our favorite hand grinder, the Hario Skerton Pro ($50), so there are certainly cheaper ways to grind, but the J-Max has always garnered high marks for its ability to deliver a very even fine grind.\n\nPhotograph: Ninja\n\nThe compact pick in our guide to the best air fryers, Ninja's Max XL is notable for its space-saving design, which leaves countertop space for other tasks such as prepping vegetables. The max crisp setting is perfect for making homemade fries with a nice amount of crunch, and you can even modify conventional oven recipes to work with the Ninja.\n\nThe trick-or-treaters are coming (or perhaps just the midnight munchies). In any case, Amazon has a bunch of candy on sale right now, with prices starting at $2. Who doesn't need a 24-pack of Nerd Ropes?\n\nThese are reviewer Louryn Strampe's favorite coffee mugs, and not just because they're a brilliant shade of pink. The cups' construction makes it appear like your drink is floating, and the 16-ounce capacity means more coffee down your gullet.\n\nPhotograph: Zwilling\n\nIf you have kids who touch everything dangerous in your kitchen, we recommend the double-walled Zwilling kettle in our Best Kettles guide. It comes with six presets, as well as a dedicated button for making baby formula.\n\nOnce our top pick for chef knives, the Victorinox is still a great knife. We really like the nearly nonstick finish\u2014hardly anything sticks to this blade, not even fresh cilantro. It's a great all-around kitchen knife and well worth grabbing at this price.\n\nBest Prime Day Coffee Deals\n\nBreville Barista Express Impress Espresso Machine Photograph: Breville\n\nWhat we love about the Breville Impress (6/10, WIRED Review) is that beginners can make good to very good espresso right out of the box. Breville has done a nice job of automating some of the trickier elements of espresso-making. The downside is that we found a good bit of variation from shot to shot.\n\nThe Barista Touch is a coffee shop in a machine. You get a built-in burr grinder, a hot water spout, and a digital display to control your brews. Tap the Latte button and the Touch will crank out a latte, even foaming the milk. The results are not as good as what you can do by hand, but it's a nice option if you're feeling lazy.\n\nThere are dozens of these milk frothers available on Amazon, from dozens of different spammy companies all selling more or less the same device. None of them are outstanding, but I bought one a few years ago and, surprisingly, it's still going. Use it to froth milk, or for what I do: mixing up matcha tea. Will this one last you years? I honestly don't know, but at least you're only out $8 if it doesn't.\n\nPhotograph: Fellow\n\nNothing beats the speed and convenience of an electric kettle for heating up water to a precise temperature. Stovetop kettles can't compete on any criteria. Plus, if you want to get into pour-over coffee, which many WIRED staffers heartily recommend, your kettle will need a gooseneck so that your pour is precise. The nearly identical EKG+ (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has a smooth pour and can hold its temperature for up to an hour before it auto shuts off, although the 2.5-foot cable could stand to be longer.\n\nWe go nuts for coffee here on WIRED's Gear Team, and the ingenious AeroPress is one of our favorite portable coffee makers. It makes a damn fine cup of brew. It also happens to be incredibly easy to use and clean up. This one will make 10 fluid ounces of coffee up to a time, which is about a diner mug's worth.\n\nBest Prime Day Mattress Deals\n\nHelix Midnight Luxe Hybrid Mattress Photograph: Helix\n\nEnter code DEALDAY25 at checkout to get this deal, which includes two pillows. This matches the best price we've seen our favorite mattress reach. The Midnight Luxe has six layers of foam and individually wrapped inner springs. It's medium-firm and comfortable for almost all sleeping positions. There are other firmness levels within the Luxe collection that we haven't tested yet.\n\nCasper's hybrid bed reaches its $1,495 price but is often $1,196 on Amazon. Still, this price is among the best deals we've tracked on a bed from the brand that put bed-in-a-box mattresses on the map. This hybrid is a great neutral option. Did you read our guide and have no idea which one to go with? Get this one. It strikes a good balance between soft and supportive, with just enough bounce.\n\nPhotograph: My Green Mattress\n\nEnter code DISCOVER at checkout to see this discount. We have seen this dip slightly lower in the past, but the base price has risen since then and this price is lower than recent sales. This is our top organic mattress pick for kids. It's made from certified organic cotton, wool, and latex.\n\nEnter code DISCOVER at checkout to apply this discount. If you aren't ready for a whole new mattress, spruce up your existing one with a mattress topper. This organic latex choice from My Green Mattress is our favorite firm topper\u2014it's 2 inches high, has a zipper if you need to remove the organic cotton cover from the pad, and stays in place nicely without needing any straps.\n\nBrooklinen Weighted Throw Blanket Photograph: Brooklinen\n\nThis price is for the terra-cotta color only. Brooklinen's weighted blanket is 12 pounds but feels sufficiently weighty. It's held up well through many trips in the wash and cat biscuit-making sessions. It's also prettier than some other options with one side having a nice texture pattern.\n\nWe like several Brooklinen sheets, and this is our favorite organic set. They're soft, but not overly silky and you shouldn't sleep too hot in them. They are made from Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)-certified organic cotton and are Oeko-Tex certified, which means they're tested for and do not contain any known toxic chemicals.\n\nThis amazing and gigantic blanket will be the focus of its own story in a few weeks' time. WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe loves it. True to its name, it's massive, measuring 10 feet by 10 feet, so it's really easy to share\u2014even if you're a blanket hog like she is. The price matches what we've seen during other shopping holidays.\n\nBest Prime Day Smart Home Deals\n\nPhotograph: Govee\n\nIn our Govee Buying Guide, we selected this as the best lamp. It has a modern design and support for Amazon Alexa as well as Google Assistant. You can select the lighting using your phone or the included remote. This price matches the lowest we have seen.\n\nTurn anything plugged into an outlet into a smart device with a smart plug. Our favorite mini smart plug from Kasa is on sale\u2014usually available for around $17, snagging these great plugs for $6 each is a steal. It's easy to control and create routines, and these bulbs work with Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Samsung SmartThings.\n\nPhilips Hue White and Color Ambiance Starter Kit Photograph: Amazon\n\nPhilips Hue's smart bulb starter kit isn't a cheap investment, and we usually only recommend it if you're looking for an upgraded kit. But it is a little cheaper right now to get three bulbs, a smart switch, and Philips' smart home hub, which you can use with older Philips bulbs and other third-party accessories. It's the lowest deal we've seen on this kit in months.\n\nThe Netgear Nighthawk series of routers are well regarded and make up some of the picks in our Best Routers guide. This model isn't one of the fancy ones, but it's a solid choice. You get Wi-Fi 6 support, coverage of up to 3,500 square feet, and the USB input means you can connect a storage drive for shared disk space.\n\nPhotograph: Newegg\n\nSitting at the top of our Best Wi-Fi Routers guide, this Wi-Fi 6 router is ideal for the average home seeking more reliable Wi-Fi on a budget. It has a slick, black finish with four antennas, performs reliably, and has four gigabit Ethernet LAN ports, a single gigabit WAN port, and a USB 3.0 port on the back. It is frequently discounted but hasn't been this low since Amazon's last Prime Day event.\n\nIf you're battling Wi-Fi dead zones in your house, you may need to add a mesh router to your setup. Our upgrade pick, Eero's Pro 6E (7/10, WIRED Recommends) makes this process as simple and hands-off as it can be, and each should one covers 2,000 square feet. The brand's subscription is pricey at $10 a month (the cheaper option was eliminated)\u2014you don't have to subscribe for it to work but there are nice features like parental controls. This older Eero router is on sale for $45 if you just need something cheap right now.\n\nSimpliSafe (9/10, WIRED Recommends) makes home security easy to set up and expand on as needed with multiple motion, door, and window sensors, plus panic buttons and key fob controllers. The brand has frequent sales\u2014and you've probably heard podcast ads with discount codes\u2014but we don't typically see it reach 50 percent off. We didn't like the indoor SimpliCam, but it has since been updated and we have yet to test the new one. Several other smaller bundles are also discounted between 40 and 50 percent off with different variations of accessories.\n\nPhotograph: Govee\n\nGovee makes some of our favorite smart lighting, and this is our pick for a diffused light strip that can be installed on the wall, stairs, or anywhere else in plain view. It comes with adhesive brackets, so you can make curved shapes like clouds. It supports countless effects in the Govee app and works with voice commands from Google Assistant or Alexa. Read our Best Govee Lights guide for more.\n\nMonster's digital frame isn't as good as options from Aura or Nixplay, which top our guide to the best digital frames, but we like it better than most other cheap frames. The 1280p screen gets you crisp photos and you can use Google Assistant or Alexa with it too. If you just can't imagine spending $150 or so on those other frames, this one works.\n\nIf you can spend more than the Monster above, we do prefer our top choices, but Skylight's 15-inch frame looks nice whether you put it on a shelf or wall mount it. There's a smaller 10-inch one if you want to spend less.\n\nEcoFlow River 2 Pro Portable Power Station Photograph: EcoFlow\n\nIt's debatable whether some of the Best Portable Power Stations are truly all that portable, but this one from EcoFlow is easy to carry, with a large handle along the back. The LiFeP04 battery inside is good for 768 watt-hours and perfect for keeping your gadgets charged up on camping trips. The main downside is fan noise.\n\nThe smaller version of this recently earned a spot in our Best Portable Chargers guide, and the larger model is our top pick of the Best Portable Power Stations, so the 1000 Plus is definitely worth a look. It packs a 1264Wh-capacity battery, loads of ports, three AC outlets, and is rated at 2,000 watts with a 4,000-watt peak power capability, which means you can plug in electric grills and other small appliances without worrying.\n\nTile Sticker Two-Pack Photograph: Tile\n\nIf you're constantly losing remotes, Tile's Stickers can come in handy. These Bluetooth tracker stickers can be stuck onto remotes, e-readers, or anything else you want to keep track of within a 150-foot range. This is the best price we've seen since last year.\n\nPetcube makes some of our favorite pet cameras, and this one holds more treats (1.5 pounds) and larger pieces (up to 1 inch in diameter) than some of the others we tried. The Bites 2 looks good and has an extensive four-microphone array that sounds great both ways. The Bites 2 Lite loses the laser and is made from plastic rather than aluminum, but it's significantly cheaper, typically at about $100. Right now it's discounted to $80.\n\nEven with the subscription ($3 per month or $30 per year), this video doorbell is one of the cheapest options around, and it made the honorable mentions section in our Best Video Doorbells guide. Video quality is 1080p with a limited field of view, and notifications aren't the fastest, but it performs reliably. If you don't want a subscription, consider buying it bundled with Sync Module 2 ($47), which is also half-price right now.\n\nNiu KQi3 Pro Photograph: Niu\n\nThis is our favorite electric scooter for most people. It goes on sale regularly, so never pay full price for one. The KQi3 has great range, going 18 to 20 miles for most people. It maxes out at 20 miles per hour, the 9.5-inch tubeless tires offer a comfy ride, and the disc brakes reliably bring it to a quick stop.\n\nEven after trying the newer Withings Body Comp smart scale, the Body+ model is still in the sweet spot for us. It tracks data about your health including body fat, muscle mass, and total body water, and can display charts of your progress over time.\n\nThis is an upgraded model of our favorite, the Body+ mentioned above. It adds extra features to keep an eye on your heart health, like its built-in heart monitor that can analyze your cardiovascular health using vascular age data. We found this wasn't totally worth the extra price on the more expensive Withings Body Comp scale, but the Body Cardio is cheaper normally, and even better on this sale.\n\nWater damage is one of the most frightening and potentially expensive disasters any homeowner can face, but if you learn about a leak swiftly enough you can keep damage to a minimum. This kit comes with four sensors and a hub and uses the relatively long-range LoRa standard to alert you the minute any of the sensors detects water. It is our pick for larger properties in our Best Water Leak Detectors guide.\n\nPhotograph: Aqara\n\nThis chunky doorbell offers 1080p video and a wide 162-degree field of view to help you monitor your front porch. It takes regular AA batteries (but can also be wired) and it comes with an indoor hub that can record video locally onto a microSD card, but also doubles as a Wi-Fi repeater and a chime. It has wide smart home compatibility, and can even be used with Apple's HomeKit Secure Video, which is what earned it a place in our Best Video Doorbells guide.\n\nIf you want to stay powered up on your travels, you need a travel adapter, and this one from Epicka is the budget pick in our Best Travel Adapters guide. It works in more than 150 countries and has four USB-A ports on the bottom, plus a 15-watt USB-C port on the side. It has dropped this low before, but not for a while.\n\nGet not one, not two, but four of our favorite smart bulbs for the best price we've seen all year. These smart bulbs are easy to use, beautifully vibrant, comes with a variety of present colors, and work with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n\nPhotograph: Nanoleaf\n\nWe love this light kit for adding fun ambient lighting to any room. Each hexagon is its own light, so you can control and customize the hexagons into just about any design of your choosing\u2014both in color schemes. and onto your wall. Just grab a level to make sure you put them on straight!\n\nThe Google Nest Hub Max has a nice big screen and slim, powerful speakers to match. It's our favorite smart display for a variety of reasons, from how nicely it doubles as a photo frame to how great it is as a kitchen assistant.\n\nBest Prime Day Home, Apparel, and Personal Care Deals\n\nTherabody Smart Goggles Photograph: Therabody\n\nTherabody's Smart Goggles (9/10, WIRED Recommends) use heat, vibrations, and light pressure to massage your eyes and temples. The app lets you customize sessions and track your heart rate to help reduce stress and anxiety. It feels amazing, but it's very expensive\u2014all Therabody products are\u2014and I noticed a small hole in the eye pad after a while. It hasn't gotten bigger, but it's worth noting. We're testing Gravity's competing eye massager right now. It's not app-controlled, but it's much cheaper and we don't hate it so far.\n\nThe TheraFace Pro is a very expensive self-care tool. We liked it, finding it exfoliated away blackheads, cleared up stuffy sinuses from allergies, and even minimized fine lines. But there are also buzzwordy functions that may or may not work, like microcurrent. It hasn't gone on sale often in its yearish shelf life so if you can afford to spend this much on a skincare device, it's a good time to grab it. Unfortunately, the hot and cold heads are an additional $99.\n\nWillow Go Wearable Breast Pump Photograph: Willow\n\nOur favorite wearable breast pump is easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to bring anywhere. What's not easy is the price tag you usually find on the Willow Go (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It's priced similarly to a standard portable pump right now, though, making it much more worth the splurge.\n\nIf you're shopping for baby gear, a good deal goes a long way with how much stuff you need before little one arrives. While insurance covers some of the cost of pumps, it's often not all of it. Depending on the insurance you have, this current deal on the Elvie Stride (7/10, WIRED Recommends) may get you closer to the price that your plan will cover.\n\nOur favorite stroller is all-around great: it comes with an adapter for infant car seats, has great suspension without being bulky, and folds down surprisingly close to flat. It's already a great deal for its regular price, and even more worth purchasing right now. We occasionally see it go a little lower than $300 on sale, but this is a great price to jump on.\n\nTushy Classic 3.0 Bidet Photograph: TUSHY\n\nA person once asked rhetorically: If you fell in the mud, would you reach for a sheet of toilet paper or a hose? They were talking about bidets, and put that way, it does seem to be a cleaner option. Certainly, it's gentler on your caboose. The Tushy is affordable and, as far as bidets go, easy to install on practically any toilet. There's no need for an electrical plug or a hot water hookup, which is why we gave it the recommendation as the best budget bidet that's non-electric.\n\nTrimming and edging the lines of a beard can be just as time-consuming and aggravating as edging a lawn. Most trimmers on the market make do with too many plastic guides of different lengths\u2014too many\u2014and yet not enough attachments for fine detailing. The Multigroom Series 9000 comes with an adjustable guide from 1 to 3 millimeters, plus a mini-foil shaver, narrow-width head, T-shaped head, ear/nose attachment, and more. Its stainless steel construction is a rarity among consumer-level trimmers, too, and feels solid in the hand, as if you're a semi-professional barber working magic rather than just a guy in a bathroom mirror.\n\nCoway Airmega 250 Air Purifier Photograph: Amazon\n\nFor larger rooms, you want a larger air purifier, and we recommend the Airmega 250 as the best air purifier for living rooms. Product reviewer Matt Jancer has been using one for years to keep the air inside his New York City apartment clean and pure. Filters tend to be expensive at $60 to 80, but he's gotten nearly a year out of each filter, so the performance-per-price is worth it, in his opinion. Its automatic functioning will kick the purifier into high gear if heavy pollution is detected, but normally it runs on a whisper-quiet low setting when needed. Even sitting a few feet away, Matt doesn't notice it.\n\nEnter code WOOF25 at checkout to see this discount. I get compliments on this Diggs carrier every time I bring my cats to the vet. It works for cats or smaller dogs and it feels high-end in its construction, with lots of pockets for you. There are safety features like seat belt clips and a buckle strap and it's also been crash-tested and gets a five-star rating by the Center for Pet Safety. The only thing I dislike is that you can't really see through the mesh to make sure your pet is OK, but the company says this is to give nervous pets some privacy and calmness.\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nA sunrise alarm wakes you up at you set time by gradually brightening and changing the color temperature, or the color spectrum, to mimic real sunlight. It's a gentler way to wake up than a blaring alarm. Like most sunrise alarms, the WiiM also has a sunset feature for winding down before bed. Of all the ones WIRED reviewer Matt Jancer tested, the WiiM was the easiest to set up and walk the user through its operation on the connected app.\n\nWIRED reviewer Matt Jancer has relied on the 35-pint model to keep his East Coast apartment habitable during sweltering, humid summers. You can set the desired humidity level in 5 percent increments from 35 to 85, and the automatic functioning will turn the machine on and off as needed. It's not particularly loud for a dehumidifier, and Jancer has to empty the water bin only once per day on his smaller model.\n\nAn electric fan is an ideal way to save a bit of money on air conditioning costs and to add a bit of pleasant white noise to boot. Unlike air conditioning, they take only a sip of electricity to run. WIRED reviewer Matt Jancer has been using the Vornado 460 for three summers and says its ability to move an impressive amount of air around a bedroom on the lowest setting belies its smallish size.\n\nPhotograph: Dyson\n\nThis has been on sale for $300 for a little while, but we still like this price. The Dyson Supersonic (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best hair dryers you can buy. It's also extremely expensive, so definitely buy it while it is on sale rather than paying full price.\n\nWe recommend this hair tool in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners. We have not seen it drop so low in price before. The flat iron is easy to use and comfortable to hold. We wish it had more temperature settings, but it's best for finer, wavier hair. If you want something simple that'll do the trick, and your hair isn't too textured, this is a solid option.\n\nThis multi-styling tool is also featured in our Best Hair Straighteners guide. It comes with round and paddle-brush attachments to get whatever look you're trying to achieve. The price is a match of the lowest we have tracked.\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nWIRED readers love LifeStraw filters, and this is the lowest we tend to see them drop in price. We include this product in our guide to the Best Home Emergency Gear. It removes 99 percent of waterborne bacteria and pathogens. At this price, you could pick one up for each member of the family.\n\nThis is very similar to a coat we recommended in our affordable cold-weather gear guide. Orolay coats consistently go viral because they're budget-friendly and warm. While we haven't tested this exact jacket, the reviews are positive and the price is right. Other coats from the brand are also on sale.\n\nA full review of this bed is coming, but the tl;dr is it's super comfy with a soft, machine-washable cover and it's big enough for adults to relax in. If you stare longingly at your pet as they snooze in their tiny beds, you might want to consider investing in your own. It's expensive though, so the $100 discount is welcome.\n\nPhotograph: Gravity\n\nThe Gravity Move (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite massage guns. It's compact but works sore muscles with ease. The Move comes with four attachment heads, including a heated one that feels heavenly. We just wish the case was bigger\u2014it only fits the device and one head at a time.\n\nNavigating the sheer amount of printer options available is exhausting. We don't have a full printer guide just yet, but after my last one died, I bought this one on the recommendation of a fellow WIRED reviewer and have been more than happy with the results. Prints and scans are good quality. It's also wireless and you can print from your phone too.\n\nYou've likely seen these candles floating around your feeds and they're great buys to treat yourself or to gift others. They're 13.5 ounces, smell good, and are hand-poured in the US. Also astrology is fun, whether you're actually into it or not\u2014according to the company, I, Nena, having been born on March 28, am reclusive by nature. Accurate!\n\nPhotograph: Loop\n\nI (Adrienne) have two pairs of these ear plugs, which are the Best for Sleep in our Best Earplugs guide. They are stylish, have different-sized ear tips, and stay put much more easily than the foam ones that you buy in a giant can. I like that they're reusable!\n\nThis handy tool has been steadily $25 for the last few months. It isn't a huge discount, but if you have pets, you need this. Roll it across your furniture to trap all the fur in its inner compartment, then just open it up and toss that fur in the trash. It works well and you don't have to worry about refilling sticky lint rollers.\n\nDog owners tend to know exactly the genetic makeup of their pups. Cat owners, not so much. Basepaws gives you a chance to learn more about your feline friends. We received PDF reports 70ish pages long detailing breed percentages and it states if they're a carrier or at risk of several health issues. Any pet can get sick at any time, but it's nice to know if you're up against something that you can maybe prevent.\n\nI (Adrienne) am currently running in these shoes, which have a wide toe box and are designed to switch easily between running on trails and roads. They're incredibly versatile.\n\nLast Prime Day, we were shocked to see that Amazon even carried one of our favorite recycled clothing brands. And lo, here we are, shocked again. This is the price we saw in July for some of the best recycled workout clothes.\n\nBest Prime Day Vacuum Deals\n\nDyson V15 Detect Cordless Stick Vacuum Photograph: Dyson\n\nThe V15 Detect holds the top spot in our Best Dyson Vacuums guide. At 7 pounds, it's lightweight, and Dyson has made it simple to convert into a handheld model. Since it's a Detect model, it also comes with a head that projects a green laser to help you spot microscopic dust\u2014making it easy to catch particles that are invisible to the naked eye.\n\nLupe's cordless vacuum (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best we tried and while it's cheaper than a Dyson, it's still very expensive even on sale. The cleaner head has a standard rotating brush and a composite foam roller, and when using its highest setting, that foam creates a strong seal against the ground. Most cordless vacs are best used in between really good cleanings with a more powerful upright vacuum, but the Lupe might be all you need. Unfortunately, it sounds terrible.\n\nThis is the best budget-friendly Dyson, and thanks to today's deal price, the vacuum is even more accessible. It can be converted into a hand vacuum and has a runtime of about 40 minutes. The included attachments will make it easier to get into the various nooks and crannies of your home.\n\nIn our guide to the Best Dyson Vacuums, we say this model is worthwhile if it's priced between $300 and $400. Well, well, well, would you look at that? Looks like the price is right. This is a solid pick for pet owners. It's similar to the Animal 3, but this model has a self-adjusting cleaner head that automatically raises and lowers the base plate to seal in suction on all floor types. There's also a motorized brush for added efficiency.\n\nPhotograph: Shark\n\nThe Shark AI Ultra 2-in-1 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite vac-mop combo in our Best Robot Vacuums guide. It vacuums well and does a thorough job of scrubbing the floors (using the included mopping bin) without getting the carpets wet. It also uses laser navigation to accurately map your home, allowing you to subdivide vacuuming and mopping zones within the easy-to-use app.\n\nThe Eufy X9 Pro (6/10, WIRED Review) doesn't work well as a stand-alone robot vacuum, but it's the best mopping vacuum we've tried. On the bottom of the X9 Pro are two mops that both rotate at about 180 revolutions per minute; it's both fast and accurate. WIRED senior associate reviews editor Adrienne So says it only took 30 minutes to mop her kitchen (including a spilled half-bottle of syrup without leaving the floor sticky), laundry room, and bathroom. The docking station dries the mops for you too, so they don't get gross.\n\nPhotograph: Roborock\n\nRoborock recently launched an upgrade to this model, our favorite robot vacuum and our current top pick. WIRED senior associate reviews editor Adrienne So says that, after several years, it's still the one vacuum she hasn't unplugged and consistently calls on to clean her house after other robot vacuums have failed.\n\nShark's AI Ultra 2-in-1 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has an amazing amount of functionality for the price compared to similar robot vac-mops out there, and that's before this sweet sale price. It uses laser navigation to map your home, and you can use an app to divide it into mopping and vacuuming areas depending on your flooring. The mopping is effective without getting your floors wet, too, and you won't need replacement bin bags. The price is specifically for the black and gold colorway, but the black and silver model is also on sale (though not as much as the gold version).\n\nBissell Little Green Machine Carpet Cleaner Photograph: Bissell\n\nThis is a match of the lowest price we tend to see for this little green machine. It made our list of the Best Carpet Cleaners and the Best Viral TikTok Gadgets. It's great for cleaning furniture, stairs, and vehicles.\n\nThis is the version of Samsung's stick vacuum that does not purport to use AI. The good news is that you probably don't really need machine learning in a vacuum, as I noted in my review (7/10, WIRED Review). This is a great vacuum if your midcentury modern home needs a vacuum to fit in with the stylish decor.\n\nRefresh your rugs with this smart carpet cleaner, which has a clever design and is fairly easy to maneuver. It is great at sucking grime out of your carpet, has a drying mode, and comes with attachments for upholstery. As the upgrade pick in our Best Carpet Cleaners guide, the relatively high price is our main criticism, so it's worth taking advantage of the discount. It does occasionally drop, but we have never seen it lower than this.\n\nIt can be a pain having to lug around a heavy carpet cleaner to deal with a spill or pet-related accident, so this portable, cordless cleaner from Bissell is handy. It is also mercifully easy to take apart and clean after you've dealt with the mess. It appears in our Best Carpet Cleaners guide as our favorite spot cleaner.\n\nBest Prime Day Lego and Other Toy Deals\n\nLego Marvel Hulkbuster Photograph: Amazon\n\nThis is not the enormous, 6,000-piece set for adults, but the version for kids. Still, commemorative theme sets tend to increase in value if you don't open them and hold them for a few years (if you can convince yourself to do that). It was $34 less when this sale first started.\n\nOne of the most gratifying parts of parenthood is realizing that your children are now fascinated by the same toys and characters that you loved when you were little. It never fails to blow my mind that my 6-year-old also knows who Optimus Prime is. This action figure transforms from a truck (very cool) into a robot (even cooler!) to save the Earth from the evil Decepticons. This would make a great holiday present.\n\nAdrienne's 6-year-old son has this playset, which they unfortunately paid full price for in a moment of weakness. It's incredibly sturdy and has lasted for several years while being stomped on and thrown into battle with other playsets. The Grimlock T-Rex motorcycle is obviously the coolest one, but siblings can share.\n\nYoto Player Photograph: Yoto\n\nKids will love this durable, portable speaker, as it can handle bedtime stories, music, and other content by slotting in cards. It also features a kid-friendly radio and a sleep mode. This appears in our Best Kids Speakers guide and is suitable for children from ages 3 to 12.\n\nIf you have a vase you love, but wish your flowers would last longer, LEGO has the answer for you. Build these artificial flowers that range from roses, poppies, daises and snapdragons to add to your favorite vessel.\n\nBehold this adorable stack of pancakes complete with a butter-and-syrup flower garnish. Have you ever seen a cuter Squishmallow? I highly doubt it. Tons of Squishmallows are on sale for Prime Day. Other options include a narwhal, hedgehog, mushroom, and possum. You can view them all here.\n\nMagna-Tiles are addicting for just about any kid, in the best kind of way. They're a STEM toy we're major fans of for a variety of ages. This set lets you build a road and cranes, so it's a great choice for any construction enthusiast or as an add-on to any current Magna-Tiles owners.\n\nFor a hazy few years, WIRED editor Adrienne So says her kids were obsessed with the Lego Ninjago series. (The show was originally commissioned as a limited run and then extended for its popularity.) This is a pretty reasonable price for a biggish 1,060-piece set that looks like a relatively simple build with a ton of minifigs.\n\nThis is a 4,049-piece set from the 2015 film Avengers: Age of Ultron, complete with three light-up arc reactors and compatibility with the Iron Man figure (sold separately).\n\nIf you're looking for a more interactive Lego set, look no further than the City Stuntz Ultimate Stunt Riders Challenge. It comes with a 360-degree loop, a ring of fire, an \u201calien tower\u201d vertical climb, a ramp, two toy motorcycles, and four Lego City minifigures. The three stunt challenges can be configured in a variety of different ways too. This is also the lowest price we've tracked for this Lego set, so far.\n\nBest Prime Day TV and Soundbar Deals\n\nSamsung The Frame Photograph: Walmart\n\nAnyone who cares about the aesthetics of their space probably doesn't want to stare at their TV screen all the time. That's where Samsung's The Frame comes in. This TV looks like a piece of art when not in use, helping it blend into the background of your well-curated space.\n\nThis quantum dot-enabled OLED is the brightest organic LED display that we've tested. It has shockingly bright colors to go with its great contrast. Small bezels also aid in a super immersive picture, making this one of the best TVs for brighter rooms.\n\nAmazon's Fire TVs are a solid and affordable way to get a quality screen for very little money. This 65-inch model has Dolby Vision support for good colors, and you can control it using your voice and Alexa.\n\nPhotograph: Hisense\n\nThe Hisense U8K is among the best-value TVs we've ever seen. It features a mini-LED display for ultra-bright colors and great contrast and is super easy to set up and use thanks to the onboard Google interface. Learn more in our full review (8/10, WIRED Recommends).\n\nHisense is a purveyor of quality mid-tier TVs, and this U7 is no exception. If you're after a larger screen to enjoy sports, the 144-Hz native refresh rate makes games (both real and virtual) look smooth as silk. I also like that it supports the latest high dynamic range codecs, so you'll get the brightest, most vibrant colors possible.\n\nIf you need a super large screen and you don't have a ton of cash lying around, this option from TCL is solid. It has support for the latest high dynamic range codecs like Dolby Vision for great colors, and the built-in Fire TV interface features essentially any app you want. It's not the brightest or prettiest TV ever, but it is big and has bold color.\n\nNanoleaf's 4D Kit (9/10, WIRED Recommends) can turn any movie or video game into a beautiful, immersive experience. The kit comes with both a trimmable light strip that fits TVs as large as 65 inches, and Nanoleaf's 4D camera that captures the TV screen's colors and projects them onto the wall behind the TV. The larger size is on sale, too, if your TV is between 65 and 85 inches.\n\nPhotograph: JBL\n\nThe JBL Bar 1300X (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with detachable wireless speakers. You can pop off the two speakers on the side of the main soundbar and place them wherever you'd like without having to worry about whether there are power outlets nearby or having to hide cables. It also has some of the best Dolby Atmos immersion we've heard from a soundbar at this price. The only downside is that, without cables, you'll have to charge the speakers between uses.\n\nYamaha's SR-C20A is our favorite affordable soundbar. It's affordable to tack onto even a very modest TV budget and its 100-watt forward-facing drivers can easily outperform the speakers on most TVs.\n\nWe're fans of nearly everything Roku offers and that includes this Streambar, which allows you to upgrade your sound and your streaming with one device. It's small enough that it's ideal for homes where space is at a premium, but still sounds good.\n\nPhotograph: TCL\n\nThis is our favorite TV to recommend for most people. The mid-tier model (7/10, WIRED Recommends) comes equipped with quantum dot technology and support for every high dynamic range (HDR) format for stunning colors. There's a game mode too, which uses software that can upscale 1080p to 120 frames per second. It's worth noting that, unlike older models, this one comes with Google TV instead of Roku. This is also the lowest price we've tracked, so far.\n\nWIRED reviewer Jaina Grey has spent a few years with this very large dual-subwoofer soundbar system from Japan. The two huge subwoofers deliver earth-shattering bass, while the two side speakers and rear speakers provide more lifelike reproduction than soundbars that bounce sound off the walls for side and rear noises. It also comes with support for all major object-based surround formats (like DTS:X and Dolby Atmos). It's great for large spaces, where the extra bass response helps things feel more cinematic. This is also the lowest price we've tracked, so far.\n\nFor the luxury-minded, this extravagant soundbar from Sennheiser is our top pick. It has massive speakers with some of the best audio quality we've seen (or heard, I suppose) of any soundbar we've tested. It's also one of the most expensive we recommend, but its price very rarely dips this low, so if you've been waiting for the perfect sale to grab one, now's the time.\n\nIf you're the type to set up smart speakers and gadgets throughout your home, this soundbar from Yamaha lets you cut down on some of that work. It comes with Amazon Alexa built in, and can control a host of other smart home gadgets. We've actually seen this soundbar's price fluctuate a fair amount recently, sometimes as low as $180, but this is still nearly the cheapest we've ever seen it, so it's a good time to grab one.\n\nBest Prime Day Camera Deals\n\nGoPro Hero10 Photograph: GoPro\n\nGoPro recently dropped the price of the Hero10 Black (8/10, WIRED Recommends) to $249, which makes it one of the cheapest action cameras on the market. It's two generations old, but still a very capable camera. This deal nets you an extra battery, case, small tripod, and other accessories. Check out our Best Action Cameras guide for more buying advice.\n\nAn upgrade over our Canon top pick in our mirrorless camera guide, the R5 features a 45-megapixel full-frame CMOS Sensor, staggeringly fast autofocus, excellent subject tracking in continuous AF mode, and dual memory card slots. It isn't cheap, but this is a pro-level beast of a camera. Note that the deal is on the body only; the lenses are sold separately.\n\nWe've seen this deal a couple of times in the past month, but it's still a good one. Sony's A7 III has been superseded by the A7 IV, but it's still a very nice camera. The 24.2-megapixel sensor has fantastic dynamic range and the decently fast phase-detection autofocus means you won't miss those key shots.\n\nPhotograph: Lexar\n\nI swear by these cards. I have been using them for seven years now without issue (back then they were much more expensive). They're fast enough for every camera that I've ever tested for WIRED, and I've never had any issue with them after years of life being tossed around in various camera bags.\n\nI remain puzzled as to why CFexpress cards are so dang expensive, but they are and if your camera uses them (and most modern, high-end video cameras do) this is about as good of a deal as we've ever seen.\n\nSanDisk 2-TB Extreme Portable SSD Photograph: Amazon\n\nOur favorite speedy portable SSD, the SanDisk is lightweight, with IP22-rated enclosures so it'll stand up to life on the go. I have been using this drive to make weekly backups for almost two years now and have had no issues. That said, our friends at Ars Technica, and other users around the web, have noted extremely high failure rates with this drive, mainly with the 2- and 4-TB versions. SanDisk has issued a firmware update, which seems to fix the problem.\n\nSamsung's T7 external solid-state drives are among the WIRED gear team's favorites. Lightning fast and reliable, solid-state drives take less babying than hard drives. The T7 Shield comes with a rubberized exterior to protect it from drops and impacts, and it's also IP65 water- and dust-resistant. It comes with a USB-C cable, fits in the palm of your hand, and doesn't require an external power source. Product reviewer Matt Jancer has been using several T7s and T7 Shields for three years and has never had even a hiccup. Other capacities are also on sale.\n\nCanon SELPHY QX10 Portable Square Photo Printer Photograph: Amazon\n\nSeveral WIRED staffers love this little printer that outputs perfectly-sized, small-but-not too-small, Polaroid-like images. Though technically it costs $150, this printer has been hovering at $129 lately, but $78 is still a solid deal. This price is for the black but the other colors are discounted to $99. The larger Canon SELPHY CP1500 printer we tried is also on sale for $99. That's also a solid price, but not uncommon.\n\nTravel and Outdoor Deals\n\nPhotograph: Amazon\n\nI (Matt Jancer) have wheeled, lifted, and slung around a lot of budget bags over dozens of trips across the globe, and the Maxlite is the one I recommend as the best budget suitcase. It's lightweight at 5.4 pounds, reasonably well made compared to the competition, and stands up to the cargo bellies of aircraft without anything more than scuff marks. For a carry-on, the two-wheel rollaboard is my preference, since it offers more interior space than a four-wheel spinner.\n\nHydro Flask routinely make some of our favorite insulated water bottles. Most insulated travel mugs these days can keep ice water cold and hot coffee warm. What makes Hydro Flask stand out is the durability of their powder coating. I've (Matt Jancer) knocked several around for years in gyms, at the base of rock climbing walls outdoors, and rolling around the floorboards of my old car and have never managed to scratch or dent one yet.\n\nThis electric bike has good looks, strong acceleration, and a better price point than the competition, especially right now with the major sale Wing is having. It's got a built-in headlight and taillight, comfortable hand grips, and a nicer seat than you'd expect. It checks a lot of boxes at its higher price point, so this is a great time to jump on this deal.\n\nWhen Is Amazon Prime Big Deal Days?\n\nAmazon's second big sale event runs from Tuesday, October 10 through Wednesday, October 11, 2023. It ends at 2:59 am ET on October 11 (11:59 pm PT).\n\nWill You Need a Prime Membership?\n\nYes, this event is for Amazon Prime members, meaning most of these Prime Day deals are for subscribers only. If you want to take the ride you need to buy the ticket. In this case, the ticket is $15 a month, and you get free two-day shipping. There are a whole bunch of other Prime Day perks you can take advantage of as well. You can also sign up for a 30-day Amazon Prime trial. Just register before the event and cancel right when the trial ends so you can take advantage of these deals. That said, there are a lot of discounted products available to folks who are not Prime subscribers. Retailers like Best Buy and Walmart are also price-matching some items or throwing their own competing sales.\n\nWhat Are Invite-Only Deals?\n\nDuring Prime Day this past summer, Amazon introduced invite-only deals\u2014a system to help make it easier for Prime members to access deals that are expected to sell out quickly\u2014and the company brought it back for Prime Big Deal Days. The feature is only available on select products but it has spread across a variety of categories and price points.\n\nIf a specific product is part of the Invite-Only Deals system, you'll see a \u201cRequest Invite\u201d button on the right-hand side. All you have to do is click it for a chance to buy the product at that sale price. However, it's important to note that there's no guarantee you'll receive the invite. You can learn more about the program and how it works in our story on How to Shop Like a Pro During Amazon Prime Day.\n\nWhen is Prime Day (Prime Big Deal Days)?\n\nThe second and presumably final Amazon Prime Day 2023 is happening right about.... now. Prime Day deals started flowing at 3 am EST on October 10 and will continue through October 11.\n\nHow to find the best Prime Big Deal Days deals?\n\nWIRED is the only publication posting about Amazon Prime Day. Wait, sorry, looks a handful of other sites are, too. But you should only read WIRED, because we actually vet every deal and compare it to the actual street price instead of an absurd MSRP that you will never observe in the wild. Also, we review the products we recommend and don't just send you Prime Day deals on junk that will break. It's only a deal if you need it and it's good!\n\nAre other retailers running sales?\n\nAmazon Prime Day has inspired many imitators and you'll find sales from competitors like Best Buy, Target, and the like. Some of these sales are great, and we'll flag when they are, but others are worth holding off on until Black Friday and Cyber Monday, when WIRED will again be the Internet's only website with deals posts.\n\nRetailer Sale Pages"

        "body": "When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your phone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality.\n\nAmazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its ever-expanding Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons. The bulk of the devices function as simple ebook readers; however, with the Kindle Scribe, Amazon looks to be moving beyond books and into the realm of writing \u2014 something that should make future Kindles function more akin to physical paper.\n\nBelow, we\u2019ve listed each model currently available. Sometimes, there isn\u2019t a deal for one or any of the products, but we\u2019ve mentioned the most recent sale price in those instances. Keep in mind that Amazon also offers 20 percent off all of its Kindles when you trade in select devices, so there are still other ways to save money when none of the models are available at a discount.\n\nImage: Amazon\n\nThe best Kindle (2022) deals\n\nWhat does it mean when a Kindle is \u201cad-supported\u201d? Amazon Kindle e-readers come in different storage configurations, but there is also an additional option that allows you to buy the e-reader with or without ads. Ad-supported Kindles will display personalized advertisements on the lock screen when it is in sleep mode or at the bottom of the homescreen when the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Typically, you save about $20 by buying the ad-supported version, but if you decide to remove ads later, you can make a one-time payment to cover the difference and remove the ads.\n\nIn case you missed it, Amazon announced a new entry-level Kindle last year, one that\u2019s designed to replace the 2019 model. The latest Kindle \u2014 which starts at $99.99 \u2014 puts Amazon\u2019s base e-reader more in line with the most recent Kindle Paperwhite, providing a number of quality-of-life improvements in the process. The new model features longer battery life, a 300ppi screen, and now charges via USB-C instead of Micro USB. It also touts 16GB of storage by default and comes in a new \u201cdenim\u201d color, which resembles the soft blue you might associate with jeans.\n\nWe recently saw Amazon\u2019s newest ad-supported Kindle drop to $79.99 ($20 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited included. Right now, though, you can only buy the Kindle at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for its full retail price. However, you can pick it up on sale at Amazon with ads, a power adapter, and a fabric cover starting at $134.97 ($15 off). Regardless of whether you choose the standalone model or the bundle, the new Kindle remains a worthwhile option if you\u2019re looking to pick up an e-reader for less than the latest Paperwhite.\n\nThe best Kindle Kids (2022) deals\n\nThe new base Kindle wasn\u2019t the only e-reader Amazon introduced in 2022. The new entry-level model has arrived alongside a new Kindle Kids, which is identical to the standard model but comes with a handful of accessories and provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books. Like the last-gen Kindle Kids, the new model retails for $20 more than the base model, bringing the MSRP to $119.99.\n\nIn terms of add-ons, the new Kindle Kids edition consists of four items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon Kids Plus. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their child access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like Percy Jackson and the entire Harry Potter series at no additional cost.\n\nWe recently saw the Kindle Kids drop to as low as $79.99 for Black Friday. Right now, however, there are no deals available, meaning you can only buy Amazon\u2019s latest Kindle Kids at Amazon and Best Buy for its full retail price of $119.99.\n\nVerge Deals on X (formerly Twitter) / Join nearly 51,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals Follow us!\n\nThe Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition is identical to the standard model but features wireless charging and a sensor to automatically adjust the backlight. Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The\n\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite (2021) deals\n\nAmazon\u2019s latest Kindle Paperwhite is its 11th-gen model, which comes with USB-C support, longer battery life, and a larger 6.8-inch display. The e-reader launched more than two years ago, and it often receives steep discounts at retailers like Amazon and Best Buy, particularly around Black Friday and throughout the holiday season. You can still occasionally pick up the last-gen model from 2018 at a discount.\n\nAmazon has also rolled out a Kindle Paperwhite Kids Edition for $169.99, which comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a year of Amazon Kids Plus, much like the aforementioned Kindle Kids. All 2021 models are also similar to the 2018 model in that they feature a waterproof design and Audible audiobook support.\n\nLastly, if you\u2019re looking for the Kindle Paperwhite Kids Edition, Amazon and Best Buy are both selling the kid-friendly ebook reader for $144.99 ($25 off), which is a relatively minor discount but likely the only one we\u2019ll see before the holiday.\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nThe best Kindle Oasis (2019) deals\n\nThe Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $249.99. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get it with or without ads on the lock screen.\n\nThe 2019 Kindle Oasis looks very similar to the previous model. It retains its waterproof 7-inch 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth. However, unlike previous models, it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.\n\nIn the past, we\u2019ve seen the 8GB Kindle Oasis drop to as low as $174.99, which remains the lowest price to date for the standalone configuration. Sadly, however, the ad-supported Oasis is only retailing at Amazon right now starting at $249.99.\n\nKindle Oasis Essentials Bundle (2019) $ 280 $ 310 10 % off $ 280 $ 280 $ 310 10 % off Amazon\u2019s latest Essentials Bundle packages the most recent Kindle Oasis with a power adapter and your choice of either a fabric or leather cover. $280 at Amazon (8GB)\n\nAs for bundles, the 8GB Kindle Oasis is currently on sale in its ad-supported configuration at Amazon with a power adapter and either a fabric cover for $279.97 ($30 off) or a leather cover for $289.97 ($30 off).\n\nImage: Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nThe best Kindle Scribe deals\n\nThe ad-free Kindle Scribe is Amazon\u2019s biggest e-reader to date \u2014 one that also represents a departure from past Kindle models. It packs a 10.2-inch display with 300 dpi, along with the same great battery life for which Kindles have become known. What separates the Scribe from other models, however, is that it comes with one of two styli, which can be used to annotate books, doodle, or jot down notes. We found the e-reader\u2019s note-taking capabilities lacking in our testing, but Amazon has already started to improve the software via free OTA software updates, helping bring it up to speed with other E Ink competitors.\n\nAs for the model with the Premium Pen, which offers a shortcut button and a built-in eraser, it\u2019s on sale in the 16GB configuration at Amazon starting at $294.99 ($75 off). You can also pick up the 16GB model with a Premium Pen, a folio cover, and a power adapter starting at $334.97 ($115 off).\n\nKindle Scribe Essentials Bundle $ 310 $ 420 26 % off $ 310 $ 310 $ 420 26 % off Amazon\u2019s base Essentials Bundle comes with a 16GB Kindle Scribe, a Basic Pen stylus, a power adapter, and one of three fabric folio covers. $310 at Amazon"

Watchara Phomicinda | MediaNews Group | The Riverside Press-Enterprise via Getty Images\n\nIt was late in the day on Oct. 27, 2021, when Fred Ruckel received the dreaded automated email from Amazon . Amazon\u2019s software had detected that Ruckel\u2019s popular cat toy, called the Ripple Rug, was being sold somewhere else for a cheaper price. His product would no longer be shown in Amazon\u2019s all-important buy box, an area of the listing where shoppers click \u201cAdd to Cart.\u201d Ruckel is the sole seller of the Ripple Rug on Amazon, so the move all but ensured his product would disappear from the website, costing him thousands of dollars per day. \u201cBelow is a list of product(s) in your catalog that are not currently eligible to be the Featured Offer because they are not priced competitively compared to prices for those products from retailers outside Amazon,\u201d according to the email, which was viewed by CNBC. Unbeknownst to him, Chewy was running a discount promotion, and dropped the price of his product by a few dollars to $39.99 \u2013 less than the $43 offer on Amazon. The algorithm had flagged it as a lower offer, even though the item on Chewy cost $48.54 after shipping and taxes. Ruckel had to make a choice: Lower the price on Amazon or ask Chewy to raise the price of his product. He opted for the latter.\n\nFred Ruckel's company Snuggly Cat makes Ripple Rug, an interactive play mat for cats. Fred Ruckel\n\nNearly three years later, Ruckel\u2019s experience hits at the core of a sweeping antitrust lawsuit filed last week by the Federal Trade Commission against Amazon. The agency accused Amazon of wielding its monopoly power to squeeze merchants and thwart rivals. For consumers, that\u2019s led to artificially inflated prices and a degraded shopping experience, the agency alleges. In the 172-page suit, the FTC said Amazon relies on an \u201canti-discounting strategy\u201d and a \u201cmassive web-crawling apparatus that constantly tracks online prices\u201d to stifle competition. The agency said Amazon punishes third-party sellers who offer cheaper products elsewhere by threatening to disqualify them from appearing in the buy box if it detects a lower price. Losing the buy box is an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to sellers\u2019 businesses, the complaint alleges. The end result of these tactics, the FTC argues, is elevated prices across the web. The company steadily hikes the fees it charges sellers and prevents them from discounting on other sites, so sellers often inflate their prices off of Amazon, creating an \u201cartificial price floor everywhere,\u201d according to the complaint. The FTC is seeking to hold Amazon liable for allegedly violating anti-monopoly law, though it has not yet outlined the specific remedies it believes would best resolve its concerns. In antitrust cases, remedies are often determined only after a court finds the defendant liable. In a blog post, Amazon general counsel David Zapolsky said third-party sellers set their own prices on the marketplace. The company also invests in tools to help sellers offer \u201ccompetitive prices,\u201d he said. \u201cEven with those tools, some of the businesses selling on Amazon might still choose to set prices that aren\u2019t competitive,\u201d Zapolsky said. \u201cJust like any store owner who wouldn\u2019t want to promote a bad deal to their customers, we don\u2019t highlight or promote offers that are not competitively priced.\u201d Zapolsky argued the FTC\u2019s lawsuit could force it to stop highlighting low prices, \u201ca perverse result that would be directly opposed to the goals of antitrust law.\u201d\n\n\u201cLong overdue\u201d lawsuit\n\nOn Amazon\u2019s own forum for merchants, called Seller Central, several users cheered on the FTC and said they hoped it would result in changes to the company\u2019s business practices. Amazon\u2019s tense relationship with merchants has been well-chronicled over the years, with sellers expressing a range of grievances over issues like rising fees, an arcane suspensions process, and heightened competition on the marketplace from all sides, including the e-commerce giant. \u201cI think it\u2019s great, Amazon deserves it,\u201d one person commented, adding, \u201cMore should be coming on the way.\u201d Amazon in recent years made the forum anonymous, but users must have a seller account in order to post. Another post included a screenshot of a message Amazon sent to sellers the day after the FTC filed its complaint, which said, \u201cAs your partners, we know that this news may generate questions for you and our business together. This lawsuit does not change anything about our relationship with you or how we operate today.\u201d One user called it \u201cBS verbiage,\u201d adding, \u201cBusinesses that sell in their store are indeed customers. And which of us has gotten good customer service?\u201d Another user described their experience in the last 12 months of selling on Amazon as \u201cbeing up all night at an effing casino but I'm stuck, the drugs are starting to wear off, but I'm trying to break even on the mortgage payment I'm using to play. That's how it is selling on Amazon right now to me.\u201d The seller went on to describe the experience as a \u201crace to the bottom.\u201d \u201cIt's long overdue,\" another commenter wrote. \"When they close me down, I'm applying for a job with the FTC.\u201d Still, others commented that the FTC\u2019s complaint is misguided. \u201cSelling on Amazon is a life-changing opportunity and the amount of sellers that throw stones at the platform is astounding,\u201d one user wrote.\n\nSeller skepticism\n\nEven sellers who may be sympathetic to the idea of regulating Amazon have concerns, specifically that the FTC's highlighted issues aren't necessarily ones that would make the seller and consumer experience better. Scott Needham, who sells on Amazon and runs a product-finder tool for other Amazon sellers, said he was \u201csurprised by some of the points that the FTC selected.\u201d\n\nwatch now\n\n\u201cI have over the years been very critical of Amazon,\u201d Needham told CNBC. \u201cI\u2019ve lost a lot of sleep because of some of the things that they have done. And the issues that they brought up, while they are interesting, they haven\u2019t created me a lot of pain.\u201d Needham said he was particularly puzzled by the inclusion of the claims that Amazon is coercive in the way it encourages sellers to use its fulfillment service, known as Fulfillment by Amazon, or FBA. Needham said many sellers \u201clove FBA\u201d because of its compelling value in terms of the price and promise to deliver two-day shipping. For many, using FBA doesn\u2019t feel like a requirement, but they believe using it will make their businesses \"easier and more effective.\" \"I think that the power that Amazon wields over sellers is considerable and absolutely worth looking into,\u201d Needham said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure if this would actually change that.\u201d Scott Moller, an Amazon seller and co-founder of an agency that helps merchants run their storefronts, said the e-commerce giant has removed some of the challenges that used to be part of running an online business. With FBA, he said, he can ship an item into one of Amazon\u2019s warehouses for $7.49 per package, while shipping it himself through a traditional carrier would cost him about $12. \u201cI don\u2019t have to have my own warehouse,\u201d said Moller, who sells grilling accessories on Amazon under the brand Grill Sergeant. \u201cI can use their staff, their storage, and I can instantly also take the data of advertising, so I can target ads.\u201d He also disputed the FTC\u2019s claim that Amazon has become littered with ads in search results, causing shoppers to wade through potentially less-relevant products of lesser quality. \u201cWe can tailor our ads to hit exactly the consumers we want,\u201d Moller said. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect marriage of a transaction, and that\u2019s one of the beauties of what their marketplace offers.\u201d Needham said he feels he would have been more supportive of the case if it were filed a few years ago, pre-pandemic. At that time, he said, \"I would have felt, yes Amazon is a monopoly\u2026 But actually after Covid, into 2023, ecommerce has had a lot of big changes.\u201d He added, \"The competition is just not what it was in 2019.\" Competitors like Shopify and Walmart are increasingly viable alternatives for many categories of sellers, Needham said, not to mention rapidly growing Chinese e=commerce companies like Temu. As a result, Needham said he\u2019s seen some significant changes from Amazon. Among those is a greater ability for Amazon sellers to communicate with buyers, offering select customers certain promotions. Shopify, for example, gives sellers much more control over how they communicate with customers, Needham said, adding that although Amazon still controls the communication process, at least there is one. \"I wish it was a clear-cut case,\u201d Needham said. \u201cI have a vested interest in the marketplace doing really well, as a seller and as a service provider. And... this case, it doesn\u2019t make the marketplace better for sellers.\"\n\nConcerns over Amazon pricing policies, fees\n\nMany sellers have zeroed in on Amazon\u2019s pricing policies and rising fees as rightful areas of concern in the FTC's lawsuit. Molson Hart, whose company Viahart sells toys on Amazon, has been a longtime critic of Amazon\u2019s pricing policies. Hart complained of how Amazon\u2019s seller fees impact pricing in a 2019 Medium post and later that year testified about his experience before a House committee. Hart said Amazon sales comprise about 90% of his business, meaning any hit those sales take on Amazon has a considerable impact. He recalled \u201c24 anxious hours\u201d in September 2022 when a third-party seller of his popular construction toy Brain Flakes listed the toy for a lower price on Target than it was offered on Amazon.\n\nMolson Hart, CEO of Viahart, an educational toy company that sells on Amazon.

But others blame the people I wanted to see in Florida, the ones who engage in the mysterious art of search engine optimization, or SEO.\n\nDoing SEO is less straightforward than buying the advertising space labeled \u201cSponsored\u201d above organic search results; it\u2019s more like the Wizard of Oz projecting his voice to magnify his authority. The goal is to tell the algorithm whatever it needs to hear for a site to appear as high up as possible in search results, leveraging Google\u2019s supposed objectivity to lure people in and then, usually, show them some kind of advertising. Voil\u00e0: a business model! Over time, SEO techniques have spread and become insidious, such that googling anything can now feel like looking up \u201csneaker\u201d in the dictionary and finding a definition that sounds both incorrect and suspiciously as though it were written by someone promoting Nike (\u201cfootwear that allows you to just do it!\u201d). Perhaps this is why nearly everyone hates SEO and the people who do it for a living: the practice seems to have successfully destroyed the illusion that the internet was ever about anything other than selling stuff.\n\nSo who ends up with a career in SEO? The stereotype is that of a hustler: a content goblin willing to eschew rules, morals, and good taste in exchange for eyeballs and mountains of cash. A nihilist in it for the thrills, a prankster gleeful about getting away with something.\n\n\u201cThis is modern-day pirate shit, as close as you can get,\u201d explained Cade Lee, who prepared me over the phone for what to expect in Florida based on over a decade working in SEO. What Lee said he\u2019s noticed most at SEO conferences and SEO networking events is a certain arrogance. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely an ego among all of them,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou succeed, and now you\u2019re a genius. Now you\u2019ve outdone Google.\u201d\n\nThe more I thought about search engine optimization and how a bunch of megalomaniacal jerks were degrading our collective sense of reality because they wanted to buy Lamborghinis and prove they could vanquish the almighty algorithm \u2014 which, technically, constitutes many algorithms, but we think of as a single force \u2014 the more I looked forward to going to Florida for this alligator party. Maybe, I thought, I would get to see someone who made millions clogging the internet with bullshit get the ultimate comeuppance. Maybe an SEO professional would get attacked by a gigantic, prehistoric-looking reptile right there in front of me. Maybe I could even repackage such a tragedy into a sensationalized anecdote for a viral article about the people who do SEO for a living, strongly implying that nature was here to punish the bad guy while somehow also assuming the ethical high ground and pretending I hadn\u2019t been hoping this exact thing would happen from the start.\n\nBecause I, too, use Google. I, too, want reliable and relevant things to come up when I look through this vast compendium of human knowledge. And I, too, enjoy the sweet taste of revenge.\n\nThe first thing that went wrong at the alligator party was the alligator was only five and a half feet long, not 10 feet, as advertised. Classic clickbait!\n\nThe second thing that went wrong at the alligator party was that I found almost everyone I met to be sympathetic, or at least nice enough not to want to see them get maimed by a five-and-a-half-foot alligator. My harshest assessment of the 200 digital marketers taking shots and swaying to a dancehall reggae band was that they dressed like they lived in Florida, which almost all of them did.\n\nTake Missy Ward, a blonde in an orange bandage dress so tight she told me she couldn\u2019t take full steps. She laughed as she explained that she\u2019d ordered the dress on Amazon and hadn\u2019t tried it on until the day of the alligator party. Ward had a feisty, wry energy that made me want to root for her. When she started doing SEO in 1998, she said, it was \u201cfive girls and all dudes.\u201d She eventually sold her company for $40 million. Somehow, in the moment, I was psyched to hear this. She was being so patient, explaining the history of SEO and suggesting other people for me to reach out to. I should really go talk with that guy across the room, who had a long-running podcast about SEO, she said, the one in the sky blue polo.\n\nHis name was Daron Babin, and I quickly learned he was just the kind of \u201cmodern-day pirate shit\u201d guy I\u2019d been warned about: thrilled at the opportunity to recount the brilliant trickery that had allowed him to line his pockets. His SEO career got going in 1994, before Google even existed. \u201cThe air of manipulation was insane,\u201d Babin told me. \u201cWe had this weird community of geeks and nerds, and we all talked to each other about how we were beating the algorithms up,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were trying to outrank other people just for bragging rights.\u201d\n\nWe were chatting on a patio overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, between the buffet and the band, when the host of the alligator party, Darren Blatt, came up to say how glad he was that I\u2019d found Daron Babin.\n\n\u201cIt was like I won the lottery, and I didn\u2019t know how long it would last.\u201d\n\nDarren and Daron (pronounced the same way) have been friends for decades, since the era when Darren \u201cD-Money\u201d Blatt would throw rap star-studded internet marketing shindigs during the Adult Video News Awards in Vegas, back when sex sites were among the most advanced in technology, and Daron Babin was using SEO to promote offshore casinos and Viagra (\u201cWe were outranking Pfizer!\u201d). Together, Darren and Daron managed to milk all three of the early online cash cows: porn, pills, and gambling.\n\nAs the internet became more regulated and mainstream, around the turn of the century, Darren noticed Daron\u2019s SEO skills were increasingly in demand. \u201cI told him that he was missing the boat, that he needed to be a consultant and charge a few grand,\u201d Darren said.\n\nDaron took the advice, asking for $2,000 a day, and watched his career explode. \u201cI would wake up in a city and not know what time zone I was in,\u201d he recalled. To slow the pace, he upped it to $5,000 a day, but \u201cit seemed the more I raised my rates, the more gigs I was getting.\u201d\n\nNowadays, he mostly invests in cannabis and psychedelics. SEO just got to be too complicated for not enough money, he told me. Ward had told me the same thing, that she had stopped focusing on SEO years ago.\n\nI was considering how it was possible that so many people have been complaining recently about SEO ruining the internet if these people were telling me the SEO business is in decline when I met Jairo Bastilla. He was the kind of tall, charming man who described himself multiple times as \u201ca nerd,\u201d and he pointed out that even though working directly with search engine rankings is \u201cno longer monetizing at the highest payout,\u201d the same \u201ccore knowledge of SEO\u201d remains relevant for everything from native advertising to social media.\n\nTranslation? SEO is now baked into everything. Bastilla, for example, specializes in email campaigns, which he called \u201cdeliverability.\u201d\n\nAs a person who militantly unsubscribes to any and all marketing emails, I suddenly felt claustrophobic, surrounded by people who annoy the rest of us for a living. Why does it always seem to surprise me, even after all these years, that the way we behave on the internet is often quite different from how we act in real life?\n\nI wandered off to wait in line for a drink, where I noticed several people nonchalantly making space in a corner, as if to move out of the way for a bartender carrying empty glasses. There, squirming along the ground, was the alligator himself, wagging his tail, snout held shut by a thin strip of electrical tape. His handler was nowhere in sight. It was an unsettling vision, a predator pretending to be just another party guest.\n\n\u201cThey should untape the mouth!\u201d someone shouted. \u201cI\u2019m not even scared.\u201d\n\nAs sunset turned to dusk, I found Daron Babin again, and he started telling me about one of his signature moves, back in the \u201990s, involving fake domain names: \u201cI could make it look like it was somebody else, but it actually redirected to me!\u201d What he and his competitors did was legal but well beyond what the dominant search engine allowed. He never faced any consequences, but in the end, internet users at large felt the effects: \u201cIt muddied up Yahoo, ultimately,\u201d he said, \u201cbut while it worked, we banked.\u201d\n\nThe situation sounded familiar. But I liked Babin. He was funny and smart, a keen observer of the SEO world. \u201cWe\u2019re entering a very weird time, technologically, with AI, from an optimization standpoint,\u201d he told me. Anyone who thought the internet was already saturated with SEO-oriented content should buckle up.\n\n\u201cAll the assholes that are out there paying shitty link-building companies to build shitty articles,\u201d he said, \u201cnow they can go and use the free version of GPT.\u201d Soon, he said, Google results would be even worse, dominated entirely by AI-generated crap designed to please the algorithms, produced and published at volumes far beyond anything humans could create, far beyond anything we\u2019d ever seen before.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not gonna be able to stop the onslaught of it,\u201d he said. Then he laughed and laughed, thinking about how puny and irrelevant Google seemed in comparison to the next generation of automated SEO. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop it!\u201d\n\nOnce I was safe at home, my alligator attack bluster having deflated into an irrepressible affection for clever scoundrels, mixed with fear about the future promised by said scoundrels, I decided to seek a broader range of the people who do SEO for a living. Perhaps the ones who live in Florida were simply too, well, Florida, and the ones who live elsewhere might be more principled? An old contact heard I was writing about SEO and suggested I find a man he called Legendary Lars: \u201cHe was an absolute god in that space.\u201d\n\nI tracked down Lars Mapstead in Northern California, where he was preparing to run for president in 2024 as a Libertarian. Mapstead spent the first two years of his life in a Volkswagen van traveling the Pacific coast before his hippie parents settled on a Big Sur property with goats, chickens, and no electricity. He became a tinkerer and an autodidact, the guy who reads the instruction manual and fixes everything himself. When he first heard about the World Wide Web, it was 1993, and he was working for a company selling computer motherboards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the freedom of information!\u201d he remembered thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s all just about collaborating and bettering mankind!\u201d\n\nHe learned how to build a website and then how to submit a site to be listed in early search directories like AltaVista, WebCrawler, Infoseek, and Lycos. He learned how to create chat rooms, attracting people spread across the globe, all alone in their homes but together online. It was beautiful. It was exciting. Mapstead saw himself as an explorer in a small but finite kingdom. \u201cI had surfed the entire internet. There wasn\u2019t a page I hadn\u2019t seen.\u201d\n\nAnd then, one day, a company in New York offered to pay him $2,000 a month to put banner ads on one of his websites, and everything changed. More clicks meant more ad dollars. Higher search engine rankings meant more clicks. So whatever it took to get a higher ranking, he learned how to do. He bought photographs of women in bikinis and made a 60-page slideshow with banner ads on each page. He realized that most search engines were just listing websites in order of how many times a search term appeared on the site and in its tags, so he focused on stuffing his sites with keywords, resubmitting his URL to the search engines, and waiting for the results to change.\n\nMapstead started pulling in $25,000\u2013$30,000 a month, working 12- to 14-hour days. \u201cIt was how long could I stay awake and how little life could I have because this was more money than I could have ever imagined in my lifetime,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt was like I won the lottery, and I didn\u2019t know how long it would last.\u201d\n\nAround this time, in 1997, an Italian professor published a journal article about what he called Search Engines Persuasion. \u201cFinding the right information on the World Wide Web is becoming a fundamental problem,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA vast number of new companies was born just to make customer Web pages as visible as possible,\u201d which \u201chas led to a bad performance degradation of search engines.\u201d\n\nEnter Google. The company revolutionized search by evaluating websites based on links from other websites, seeing each link as a vote of relevance and trustworthiness. The founders pledged to be a neutral navigation system with no ads: just a clean white screen with a search box that would bring people off of the Google landing page and out to a helpful website as seamlessly as possible. Users quickly decided this link-based sorting methodology was superior to the existing search engines, and by the end of 1999, Google was handling the majority of online queries.\n\n\u201cI was basically just spamming Facebook with cars and articles about cars and sending traffic to banner ads, and that turned into $120,000 a month.\u201d\n\nMapstead, like many of the early practitioners of SEO, figured out how to adapt. Almost as soon as Google took over, a secondary market emerged for links. For a few hundred bucks, a firm in India or the Philippines could provide thousands of links from blog networks built entirely for that purpose. It was easy: buy links that led to your site and watch your ranking in Google\u2019s results rise.\n\nI came to understand that, since the dawn of the internet, there have been people attempting to manipulate search and then people decrying those manipulations as the end of search\u2019s ability to be useful. It works in cycles. People doing SEO find loopholes in the algorithm; critics complain about search results; search engines innovate and close the loopholes. Rinse, repeat.\n\nBefore our current moment of widespread disillusionment with online information, the rise of SEO had reached a breaking point multiple times. In 2003, as Google approached the deadline to disclose pertinent business information leading up to its IPO, the company quietly released an update cracking down. By 2011, SEO was once again oppressively pervasive. TechCrunch published a story called \u201cWhy We Desperately Need a New (and Better) Google,\u201d which argued that \u201cGoogle has become a jungle: a tropical paradise for spammers and marketers.\u201d In the next year, Google made two major changes to the algorithm, which came to be called Panda and Penguin.\n\nWhile the public might have experienced each of these updates as a relief, Mapstead and his SEO compatriots saw them as devastating. \u201cThey change the rules instantly overnight, and then you\u2019re out of business,\u201d he told me. \u201cHere you\u2019re trying to rely on this business model to feed yourself and your family, and they\u2019re pulling the rug from underneath you, and you\u2019ve gotta scramble to pay rent.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t worry about Mapstead. This is a guy seemingly blessed with a never-ending mental stream of schemes. He helped start a handful of companies, including the once-ubiquitous hookup site AdultFriendFinder, which sold in 2007 for $500 million. He tried to retire after that but got bored and started a couple of Facebook pages devoted to his passion for hot rods and custom cars. This was during the peak years for social media, and just as Bastilla had described back at the alligator party, Mapstead\u2019s \u201ccore knowledge of SEO\u201d came in handy. Before long, his pages had 25 million followers. \u201cI was basically just spamming Facebook with cars and articles about cars and sending traffic to banner ads, and that turned into $120,000 a month,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd that was supposed to be my hobby!\u201d\n\nAs I spoke with more SEO professionals around the country, I began to think that the reason I found them endearing and not evil was that while many had made quite a bit of money, almost none had amassed significant power. Unlike the Elon Musks and Jeff Bezoses of the world, who went from geeky teenagers to masters of the universe, the dorks who grew up to do SEO have stayed the butt of the joke, beholden to the fluctuations of the algorithm, frantically pulling levers behind the scenes but ultimately somewhat hapless.\n\nI mean, have I even mentioned that they call themselves \u201cSEOs\u201d? Really. They say things like, \u201cAs the SEO, my job is to get more traffic.\u201d This title feels thirsty to be seen as similar to a CEO, to be taken seriously. And compared to the rest of the tech world, SEO has always lacked a certain glamor or a certain messiah complex. Case in point: while many of the tech CEOs claiming to save the world these days live in Miami, the alligator party was an hour up the coast in Fort Lauderdale.\n\n\u201cThe SEO people are just trying to make money,\u201d said Peter Kent, the author of several dozen explanatory tech books, including SEO for Dummies and Bitcoin for Dummies. \u201cThe cryptocurrency people are trying to make money, but they\u2019re also trying to overthrow, you know, the existing system.\u201d\n\nKent has done his fair share of SEO jobs but also has something of an outsider\u2019s perspective. For years, he\u2019s been telling people that part of the SEO industry\u2019s reputation problem is that 80 percent of SEOs are scammers.\n\n\u201cA lot of companies and individuals out there selling their services as SEO gurus don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing or don\u2019t really give a damn,\u201d he explained. As a consultant, he\u2019s often had businesses ask him to vet the work of other SEOs. \u201cI would take a look at their site and determine the firm had done next to nothing and had been charging thousands a month for years on end.\u201d\n\nWhen I ran this 80 percent scam figure by other SEOs, most agreed it sounded accurate, though people were divided about what to ascribe to greed and what was just stupidity.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t because they have a scammer\u2019s heart,\u201d said Bruce Clay. \u201cIt\u2019s because they don\u2019t have the real expertise.\u201d Clay is an avuncular man with a mustache who is often credited with coining the phrase \u201csearch engine optimization\u201d and is therefore called \u201cthe father of SEO.\u201d He told me his agency never hires an SEO with less than a decade of experience.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you can trust anything you read online.\u201d\n\nThough Google publishes guidelines explaining how to do better in search (\u201cMake your site interesting and useful\u201d), the exact formula for how and why one website gets placed over another is top secret, meaning that SEO involves a lot of reverse engineering and guesswork. With no clear chain of cause and effect around why a site\u2019s ranking has changed, a less talented practitioner can take on the mien of a premodern farmer, struggling to figure out how to make it rain. Should he do that dance he did last year the night before it poured? Or maybe sacrifice his firstborn?\n\nThe algorithm is just too opaque, too complicated, and too dynamic, making it easy for scammy SEOs to pretend they know what they\u2019re doing and difficult for outsiders to sort the good SEOs from the bad. To make things even more confusing for, say, a small business looking to hire someone to improve their Google ranking, even a talented SEO might need a year of work to make a difference, perhaps implying a good SEO was a scammer when in fact, the client was just being impatient or refusing to implement essential advice. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of effort that\u2019s required to do things to move the needle, and a lot of companies aren\u2019t willing to put out the money for that, even though it may be worthwhile in the long run,\u201d said John Heard, a longtime SEO based in Kansas.\n\nOf course, some people bristled at the very suggestion that the industry is filled with con artists. \u201cThere are a lot of scammers in every single business. It\u2019s just easier to call yourself an SEO than a doctor,\u201d said Barry Schwartz. Schwartz is an unbelievably fast talker and a prolific writer who has spent the past two decades covering SEO for the trade rag Search Engine Land. Both over the phone with me and in his work, he has defended SEO as a legitimate, dignified pursuit: \u201cThe search community is filled with hard-working individuals working to help their clients\u2019 websites succeed in Google Search. That success is not done through dark, corrupt or shady tactics but rather hard, smart and thorough work.\u201d\n\nSeveral people that I spoke to made a similar point: the best SEOs are the ones that follow Google\u2019s rules, which essentially ask you to make amazing websites without even thinking about Google. You are not supposed to make any attempt to artificially boost a website\u2019s ranking; you are supposed to be designing websites for human readers, not for the algorithm. And many SEOs do exactly this kind of work: rewriting copy, making a site load more quickly, etc. But the existence of good SEOs does not negate the presence of scammers and idiots and people who get ahead by violating Google\u2019s terms of service, just as the mild-mannered teacher\u2019s pet in a classroom does not negate the obnoxious shouting of the kids that refuse to behave. A few loud kids can easily drown everyone else out.\n\nEven Schwartz acknowledged the effect that the rule-breaking SEOs have had on the internet experience. We get to talking about the types of small businesses that are particularly lucrative customers for SEOs, including lawyers, accountants, and contractors, because these are the professions eager for attention from all the people going online to find local recommendations. If Schwartz himself had to hire a reliable attorney, I asked, what would be the best way to do so?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you can trust anything you read online,\u201d he told me. \u201cMaybe you ask a friend.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing so much about what it was like to be an SEO, I decided it was time to better understand what\u2019s been going on from the perspective of the search engine. Google was slow to allow someone to talk with me, possibly because of the giant PR clusterfuck that has been the company\u2019s past year (accused by the federal government of being a monopoly; increasingly despised by the public; losing ground to Reddit, TikTok, and large language models), so I decided to start by meeting up with a chipper, charismatic man named Duane Forrester.\n\nForrester was at Microsoft from 2007 until 2015, where he helped launch and manage Bing, the perpetual underdog to Google\u2019s domination of online search. Before and after his time at Microsoft, Forrester worked as an SEO, so he sees the industry from both sides, like an aerospace engineer who spent a few years at the Department of Defense, left for the private sector, and now is much better at winning military contracts. Forrester has a holistic understanding of the delicate push and pull between the SEOs desperate for clues on how to do their jobs better and the search engine trying to keep its secret-sauce algorithm proprietary. He also knows a huge range of people in the industry. Like Schwartz, he wanted to emphasize how hard everyone works. \u201cI\u2019ve lost track of how many people I know who built companies and sold them and have just, like, made wealth,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat is not a 40-hour commitment in the week. That is a 400-hour commitment.\u201d (For the record, there are 168 hours in a week.)\n\nThese days, Forrester lives in Los Angeles, and he asked me to meet him at one of his favorite restaurants, which felt like a British pub operated by Disney World, tucked away in a desert strip mall. Inside, every inch was covered in Anglophile paraphernalia, including Union Jack flags, a mural of Big Ben, and a red phone booth. Over a full English breakfast, he told me about growing up in rural Canada, where his parents owned a motel. As a kid, he used to mess around with the pay phone outside, eventually figuring out how to finagle free long-distance phone calls. \u201cAnd then it became, \u2018What else can I know how to do?\u2019\u201d\n\nBy the \u201990s, Forrester was trading tips with other SEOs in online forums. He still remembers the thrill of the very first SEO conference he went to, where he was asked to speak. \u201cThe people who got up onstage to talk were seen as somehow more knowledgeable, but I don\u2019t know that we felt that way,\u201d he said. \u201cYou all kind of knew you were making shit up.\u201d\n\nAfter years of being friends online, the SEOs were eager to let loose in person, giving off what Forrester described as \u201cthat vibe of a lot of young people with access to a lot of money. And it was like, no expenses spared in New York City.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst thing you\u2019ve ever done?\u201d\n\nFor Forrester, it was the start of a long career of keynote presentations and consummate schmoozing \u2014 Clay, the father of SEO, described him to me as \u201ca cruise director\u201d on the SS SEO. The conference circuit has treated Forrester well. He\u2019s attended events in Napa, Hawaii, and Barbados, among many others, as well as \u201can infinite number of private dinners and these types of things in every city you can think of, at the most lavish restaurants,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve lost track of how many Michelin-starred meals I\u2019ve had, \u2019cause it\u2019s now in the dozens, from my time in this industry. And I\u2019m not going to say no to the dinner that everyone\u2019s going to, that one company is sponsoring because it\u2019s a thank you to everybody who contributed to, whatever it was, you know? And you go and everybody has a good time. You talk about the industry, and that\u2019s it. And it becomes the stuff of legends.\u201d\n\nOver the years, he\u2019s seen it all. He remembered \u201cwalking into hotel rooms and it\u2019s two o\u2019clock in the morning, there\u2019s drugs and alcohol and everything everywhere, and there\u2019s a party going on.\u201d Forrester marveled at the audacity of his fellow SEOs. \u201cSomebody showed up and brought her Aston Martin to a conference and parked it at the front door. Immediately got a parking ticket.\u201d He suggested she might want to relocate the car before it got towed, but the woman told him she would just move it to the next parking spot and get another ticket. \u201cShe goes, \u2018It\u2019s cheaper for me to leave the car parked out front and use it as a way to start conversations with potential clients than it is for me to rent a suite at the hotel and get people to go to the suite to have the same conversation.\u2019\u201d Then, she offered to take Forrester for a joyride around Seattle. Obviously, he said yes.\n\nOnce he represented Bing, Forrester more or less stopped drinking at conferences, as had long been the case for his counterpart at Google, an engineer named Matt Cutts, who helped build and then ran the company\u2019s web spam team before stepping back in 2014 and leaving in 2016.\n\nCutts was a celebrity among SEOs, constantly mobbed with questions and complaints. When we spoke on the phone, he told me that before he left, he determined that he had sent about 50,000 emails to people outside of Google during his decade and a half at the company.\n\nSeveral SEOs described trying to get Cutts to drink at conferences so he would \u201cspill secrets,\u201d as one put it, but what generally ended up happening was that all the SEOs would get drunk instead. Meanwhile, Cutts would stay sober, jotting down the latest SEO methods on a small notepad, sitting quietly in the corner at the bar.\n\n\u201cMy favorite question to ask an SEO,\u201d Cutts told me, was, \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst thing you\u2019ve ever done?\u201d which prompted responses that felt like \u201ca cross between showing off and a confessional.\u201d So many SEOs were tempted to reveal the vulnerabilities they\u2019d discovered in Google\u2019s algorithms, even when they were talking to the one person they really shouldn\u2019t have been talking to, the guy who was planning to go back to his office and make those vulnerabilities disappear.\n\nAs a former SEO himself, Forrester understood that the quality of Bing\u2019s search results would be impacted by the work of SEOs, so it made sense to communicate with SEOs as much as possible. Cutts similarly tried to serve as a conduit between SEOs and Google, but Forrester felt that Google projected an attitude he described as: \u201cWe know what we\u2019re doing, we will stop your attempts to game this, and you know what? We\u2019ll just kind of ignore you, and when you give us feedback, eh, we don\u2019t really care.\u201d\n\nCutts, as an individual, seemed to be doing his best within an expanding corporate behemoth to remain approachable. \u201cOne thing I learned early on was that even when someone was shouting at you, there\u2019s a kernel of something you needed to hear in the other person and listen to and respect and integrate and incorporate,\u201d he told me. Most SEOs told me they appreciated his efforts. When Google released the 2011 Panda update that devastated a generation of SEO businesses, Cutts openly recognized the impossible task of achieving the kind of epistemological neutrality that Google\u2019s founders had initially promised, telling Wired at the time, \u201c[T]he only way to be neutral is either to randomize the links or to do it alphabetically.\u201d\n\nStill, some blamed him personally for \u201ckilling\u201d companies that had relied on the previous iteration of the algorithm. During his time at Google, Cutts regularly received death threats and hate mail. When SEOs would send, say, a fruit plate or a brownie cake addressed to him at Google\u2019s offices, he told me, \u201cWe\u2019d take it down to the kitchen with a note warning: possibly poisoned.\u201d\n\nAfter Cutts left, Google replaced him with a handful of people, none of whom could quite fill his shoes: \u201cThose personalities sometimes were standoffish,\u201d Forrester told me. \u201cSome of them were superior. Some of them were a bit too wallflower.\u201d\n\nOne of the people Google brought in was Danny Sullivan, a former journalist who started Search Engine Land, the industry publication where Schwartz works, back in the 2000s. In 2009, Sullivan was described as \u201cthe closest approximation to an umpire in the search world,\u201d so when he published \u201cA deep look at Google\u2019s biggest-ever search quality crisis\u201d in 2017 and then took a job as Google\u2019s public liaison for Search only a few months later, it felt to some SEOs as though a congressperson working on gun safety legislation had quit to become an NRA lobbyist.\n\n\u201cThere is a thread across the industry of people who believe that Google just made Danny an offer he couldn\u2019t say no to, and it was designed essentially to take his voice out of the conversation,\u201d Forrester told me. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the case,\u201d he went on, but compared to Cutts, \u201cI think that Danny specifically stays out of a lot of public conversations because he is in those private conversations with businesses.\u201d\n\nWas all that really Google\u2019s fault? Or the SEOs? Or was this about something deeper and more human: the will to exploit something so much we destroy it.\n\nWhen I finally manage to jump through the flaming rings necessary to be allowed to speak on the phone with Sullivan, albeit with a communications chaperone also on the line, I find him angry and defensive. He\u2019s annoyed that anyone would think his era at Google has been less transparent than Cutts\u2019 was: \u201cWe have reams of help documents!\u201d he told me. \u201cWe have more people assigned to work with SEOs than we did when Matt worked here!\u201d\n\nSullivan is mad that the public and the media don\u2019t really understand what he considers to be basic precepts about how search works, leading him to adopt a rather scolding tone online. He\u2019s frustrated that people want to know every last detail about Google\u2019s algorithm because even \u201cif we listed all one thousand of the ranking signals\u201d and how much each was worth, he said, that wouldn\u2019t actually help SEOs do their jobs better, anyway.\n\nAnd most of all, Sullivan is pissed that people think Google results have gone downhill. Because they haven\u2019t, he insisted. If anything, search results have gotten a lot better over time. Anyone who thought search quality was worse needed to take a hard look in the mirror.\n\n\u201cWe have an entire generation that grew up expecting the search box to do the work for them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe might do a better job of matching for a bulk of people, but for people who are super sensitive, when they have that fail moment, now it becomes, \u2018All my searches aren\u2019t good.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe problem was not Google. The problem was not SEOs. The problem was kids these days.\n\nOf course Sullivan would say this, though. He works for Google. I felt like I began to understand why many SEOs had told me that Cutts\u2019 departure had marked a major turning point in the history of the internet, emblematic of Google\u2019s transition from idealistic startup to one of the most valuable and powerful companies to ever exist. Over the phone, Cutts came off as humble and thoughtful, acknowledging the nuances and challenges of the search engine business, while Sullivan sounded like an impatient corporate stooge, trying to gaslight me into believing the sky was red.\n\nBut here\u2019s the part where I started to feel the way I\u2019ve felt so often in recent years, like I was losing my grip on reality: Sullivan was not the only person who tried to tell me that search results have improved significantly. Out of the dozen-plus SEOs that I spoke with at length, nearly every single one insisted that search results are way better than they used to be. And except for Sullivan, these were not people with an incentive to praise Google. If anything, these were folks who lamented how much harder it had become for them to take advantage of Google. Today, they told me, search results are just objectively more accurate. More useful. More difficult to manipulate.\n\nThis was not what I had been noticing, and this was certainly not what I had been hearing from friends and journalists and friends who are journalists. Were all of us wrong? Or engulfed in some kind of Baader\u2013Meinhof frequency bias delusion? Had I been researching a nonexistent problem? Were Google results actually amazing? Truly, I had lost the plot. Was the premise of this piece completely off? Was I the asshole who deserved to be attacked by an alligator?\n\nI began to worry all the people who were mad about search results were upset about something that had nothing to do with metrics and everything to do with feelings and ~vibes~ and a universal, non-Google-specific resentment and rage about how the internet has made our lives so much worse in so many ways, dividing us and deceiving us and provoking us and making us sadder and lonelier. Decades of American optimism about the wonderful potential of technology, from the Moon landing to personal computers to the iPhone, had finally, in the last few years, broken down into comprehensive chagrin at the petty, pathetic, and violent world enabled by our devices. Was all that really Google\u2019s fault? Or the SEOs? Or was this about something deeper and more human: the will to exploit something so much we destroy it. To muddy it up, as Babin had put it, but while it worked, to make as much fucking money as possible.\n\nThe person who helped me snap out of my confusion spiral was an SEO named Lily Ray. Ray is a 30-something jet-setter with black-line tattoos and an asymmetrical, dyed blonde pixie cut. I managed to catch her for lunch in Brooklyn between speaking gigs in Chicago and Berlin on a day when she was also simultaneously managing a 35-person team at her digital marketing agency, posting multiple times an hour on social media, dog-sitting for a Pomeranian whose \u201cdaddies\u201d were at Burning Man, caring for her own mini Australian shepherd, and organizing the house party she was hosting that weekend \u2014 a party she expected to be late for because she first had to drop by a rooftop to perform a DJ set at a different party.\n\nRay reassured me that I was not crazy. Google results today do feel different from how they felt just five or six years ago for two major reasons. The first was Google\u2019s response to the disinformation panic around the 2016 election, which involved questioning the notion that the most reliable information could be chosen by a form of popularity, meaning how many links a site received from other sites. As a result, the algorithm seemed to change its approach to links, especially when it came to news and sites offering legal, financial, or health advice, and instead paid more attention to what Google came to call E-E-A-T: experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness.\n\n\u201cE-E-A-T has had a pretty big impact on what types of results you see,\u201d Ray told me. She\u2019s done extensive (and fascinating) research around how certain sites have fared under these new guidelines: Urban Dictionary, down! Mayo Clinic, up! Some people consider EEAT part of what\u2019s making results better than ever. Others see it as a form of censorship, disproportionately affecting right-wing perspectives. Not every search query takes EEAT into account; Google has described heightened concern over sites that could impact safety, happiness, and the ability to be an informed citizen. But the point that really hit me was that for certain kinds of information, Google had undone one of the fundamental elements of what had made its results so appealing from the start. Now, instead of wild-west crowdsourcing, search was often reinforcing institutional authority.\n\nYou can\u2019t just be the most powerful observer in the world for two decades and not deeply warp what you are looking at\n\nThis felt complicated at best. When it comes to health and wellness, for example, quackery is often in the eye of the beholder. Everyone knows someone who has struggled with the limits of Western medicine. So much of the original draw of the internet was the opportunity for outlier voices to be heard alongside established experts and elites. Looking back on all that had changed around what first attracted people to Google, from the introduction of ads to the efforts to keep users within the universe of Google products, this seemed to be the last straw.\n\nThe second major reason why Google results feel different lately was, of course, SEO \u2014 specifically, the obnoxious-kid-refusing-to-behave-in-class kind of SEO.\n\n\u201cSEO that goes against Google\u2019s guidelines, it\u2019s not new,\u201d Ray explained. A decade ago, it used to be called \u201cblack hat\u201d SEO, in comparison to the search engine-approved \u201cwhite hat\u201d tactics. And Google has, as Sullivan and many SEOs told me, gotten better over time at catching SEOs playing tricks on the algorithm. Although many of us may have rosy memories of how magical and cool Google seemed in the early days, most SEOs consider the years between 2003 and 2011 to be the boom times, when you could still get a fake corporate website listed above the real corporate website, and you could mess with the search results for a major political figure such that something sexual or racist would come up first.\n\nGoogle is harder to game now \u2014 it\u2019s true. But the sheer volume of SEO bait being produced is so massive and so complex that Google is overwhelmed. \u201cIt\u2019s exponentially worse,\u201d Ray said. \u201cPeople can mass auto-generate content with AI and other tools,\u201d she went on, and \u201cin many cases, Google\u2019s algorithms take a minute to catch onto it.\u201d\n\nThe future that Babin had cackled about at the alligator party was already here. We humans and our pedestrian questions were getting caught up in a war of robots fighting robots, of Google\u2019s algorithms trying to find and stop the AI-enabled sites programmed by SEOs from infecting our internet experience.\n\nEventually, a site filled with computer-generated nonsense designed to maximize SEO will get removed from search results, Ray explained, but while it\u2019s up, the creator might make as much as $50,000 or $100,000 a month. A lot of the people who did this, she said, live cheaply overseas in places like Bali and Chiang Mai. \u201dThey make a bunch of money, that site dies, and they go do it again,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a churn and burn strategy. So if people are seeing those results, it can be very frustrating for users \u2018cause it\u2019s like, \u2018This is terrible.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd yet, as much as she despises what this kind of SEO has done to the internet, Ray told me she hesitated to condemn the actual people doing it. \u201cI used to do those types of tactics, so I couldn\u2019t hate on anybody personally,\u201d she said. \u201cIf people have a problem with Google\u2019s results, they have to ask themselves, is it the fault of the SEOs?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr is this Google behaving differently than it used to?\u201d\n\nSullivan had tried to convince me that Google was not behaving differently and, in fact, had not changed its search criteria in any major way for the past 20 years. Google wanted you to make good websites, and that was that. Everyone who tried to rank higher by messing with the algorithm would be blocked. Sullivan even insisted that what these rule-breakers did should not be called SEO: he deemed it all \u201cspam.\u201d What is spam? \u201cSpam is stuff that search engines don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nBut the line between strategies that violate Google\u2019s terms of service and strategies that don\u2019t has always been blurry and inconsistently enforced. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this much tension in the industry in terms of, like, what Google says to do and what people are doing and getting away with,\u201d Ray told me. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna tell us that this stuff doesn\u2019t work, make it stop working!\u201d\n\nRay seemed like the most reasonable person I had spoken to so far. Sure, she called herself a \u201cthought leader,\u201d and yes, sure, she had changed her last name to improve her personal branding by more closely associating herself with her grandmother\u2019s uncle, the artist Man Ray. Maybe some people would say that\u2019s the kind of absurd behavior that merits being attacked by an alligator, but I was beginning to come down on the side of the SEOs, who seemed to have a lot less agency than I\u2019d first imagined.\n\nGoogle had started with a noble cause: trying to make the internet easier to navigate at scale. The company did accomplish that goal, but in doing so, it inadvertently and profoundly changed how the internet looked. The problem lay in Google trying to be an objective and neutral arbiter of an information landscape that was meant to pretend it did not exist. You cannot design a free, automated system to help people find information without some people trying to game that system. You can\u2019t just be the most powerful observer in the world for two decades and not deeply warp what you are looking at.\n\nFor the past 25 years, the internet as we know it has been almost entirely defined and controlled by Google. What the SEOs do matters for all of us on a daily basis, distorting how we perceive the world in ways we can hardly begin to imagine or understand. Yet any money that any SEO has made is a fraction of a crumb compared to Google\u2019s 10-layer cake. The company brings in hundreds of billions of dollars a year, profits that skew Google\u2019s choices and priorities. As Google\u2019s founders wrote back in 1997: \u201cwe expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s Google\u2019s world, and the SEOs are only living in it\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why most countries around the world have libraries that are public institutions: information that is controlled by a private business will always be subject to that business\u2019s bottom line. In the beginning, the internet was seen as an improvement on the spirit of the public library. Here was an opportunity to transcend the gatekeepers controlling who could publish a book, allowing mankind to fully connect and share knowledge. Instead, we have ended up in a situation arguably worse than before, where nearly all online information runs through a single company, which assumes a veneer of civic utility, of impassive authority, when it is very much not a neutral entity.\n\n\u201cThere were so many true believers at Google in the early days,\u201d Cutts told me. \u201cAs companies get big, it gets harder to get things done. Inevitably, people start to think about profit or quarterly numbers.\u201d He claimed that, at least while he was there, search quality always came before financial goals, but he believes that the public underestimates how Google is shaping what they see, saying, \u201cI deeply, deeply, deeply believe search engines are newspaper-like entities, making editorial decisions.\u201d He speculated that the company didn\u2019t want the public to think too hard about how search works because that awareness \u201cencourages regulators and makes people realize, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a lot of money here.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere has always been advertising and polemics from cranks, scammers, and liars. But now we see this stuff surfacing alongside truth, and we can\u2019t tell the difference. We move through our lives with a greater sense of distrust and fear and insecurity. At the end of the day, it\u2019s Google\u2019s world, and the SEOs are only living in it.\n\nAnd as much as I might hate the way the SEOs who don\u2019t follow Google\u2019s rules have altered my online experience, the reality is that most people running a company will break whatever rules they are able to get away with breaking. While Ray herself said she has left behind the guideline-violating tactics of her past, choosing instead to do as Google asks and make high-quality websites that will \u201cmake the internet a better place,\u201d as she put it, that kind of moral standard can be a lot to ask of someone running a business.\n\n\u201cThey want this wholesome thing, and I can understand that. That\u2019d be neat,\u201d said an SEO named Cade Lee. \u201cBut that\u2019s maybe in a world where we don\u2019t have money and greed and things, you know?\u201d\n\nLee was the person I spoke with on the phone before going to the alligator party, the guy who warned me that SEO was \u201cmodern-day pirate shit.\u201d He is among the SEOs who have spoken publicly, on panels, about violating Google\u2019s guidelines. He\u2019s also an ex-con who used to trade penny stocks and served time for securities fraud. His entire body is covered in tattoos, from his scalp to his legs to his fingers. When we met up for beers in Denver at a bar outside an escape room, he told me that his probation officer in the economic crime offenders unit has never tried to stop him from violating Google\u2019s terms of service.\n\n\u201cI was transparent about it, and they approved it,\u201d he said. They even approved \u201csome pretty questionable things, like in regards to adult sites,\u201d he told me, specifically involving what he\u2019d thought were ads for consensual sex workers. Later, an activist reached out and showed him how certain websites he had built were supporting human trafficking. Horrified, he shut the whole thing down, even then helping the activist with her website.\n\nThese days, Lee runs a construction company. His probation officer hates when he phrases it like this, but he thinks any way you make money is essentially a con or a scam of some kind. \u201cThe good con is like, you actually delivered, and you came through and made a profit.\u201d For example: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna take that old lady\u2019s money to build her a brand new patio. There\u2019s that scam, and then there\u2019s, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s take her deposit and run.\u2019\u201d Lee is the kind of guy who has spent a lot of time thinking about his place in the world: what matters, what doesn\u2019t, and how his actions affect other people. He was in the Marines, he sold mortgages in the lead-up to the 2008 crash, he went to prison, he\u2019s done SEO. He understands that he needs to make money to survive, but he\u2019d like to do so in a way that is minimally harmful. So he prefers the good kind of con.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happened with SEO for me \u2014 it was becoming bullshit,\u201d he says. \u201cI was not feeling good about customer meetings and about what I was saying, and I was like, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u2019\u201d"

        "body": "On Monday, Fortnite publisher Epic Games will drag a tech giant into court, alleging that its mobile app store is an illegal monopoly. You may be feeling some d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!\n\nAfter all, didn\u2019t Epic already go to trial with Apple, resulting in a ruling where Apple (mostly) won? Didn\u2019t Epic fail to #FreeFortnite with its Llamacorn legal gambit? Didn\u2019t that all happen years ago? What are we doing here again?\n\nThe short answer: while Epic\u2019s antitrust claims against Apple got their day in court, a similar lawsuit against Google never did. On November 6th, Epic v. Google will finally go to trial... a mere 1,180 days after Epic originally sued.\n\nHi, I\u2019m Sean, and I\u2019ll be your guide to this whole delightful mess.\n\nUpdate, December 15th, 2023: It\u2019s basically over now. What happened? Read this, this, and this to get the whole picture.\n\nOriginal story continues:\n\nLlamacorn what now? What is happening?\n\nBefore we get to the Llamacorn, a little background. Epic is of course the studio behind Fortnite, the extraordinarily popular free-to-play game. Fortnite makes money by selling in-game items with its virtual currency V-Bucks. Players often buy V-Bucks the same place they play Fortnite. And until August 13th, 2020, if the player used an Android or iOS device and installed the game through an official app store, that purchase triggered an in-app payment fee to Google or Apple.\n\nCritics call such fees the \u201cGoogle tax\u201d or the \u201cApple tax,\u201d and Epic definitely wasn\u2019t a fan.\n\nWhen Epic decided to take action against these respective \u201ctaxes,\u201d it made August 13th, 2020 a very busy day for Apple, Google, Epic, and us here at The Verge. First, Epic announced it was bypassing Apple and Google\u2019s app store fees. It deployed a hotfix update to Fortnite without either company\u2019s knowledge, letting you purchase V-Bucks directly through its own payment processing option at a discount. Apple and Google almost immediately reacted by kicking Fortnite off their app stores for breaking the rules.\n\nThen: surprise! Epic was ready and waiting with two lawsuits and an attack ad, depicting a Fortnite hero throwing a unicorn-llama hammer into a giant screen reminiscent of Apple\u2019s famous \u201c1984\u201d Macintosh ad.\n\nIt was a striking publicity blitz followed by a lot of slow-moving court proceedings. While the Apple lawsuit went to court in 2021, the Google one was delayed again and again. A ruling came down for the Apple trial that September, and it was mostly decided in Apple\u2019s favor, though both parties are waiting for the Supreme Court to potentially weigh in. Meanwhile, the machinations for its fight against Google continued, and now\u2026\n\nIt is time for trial number two.\n\nThat sounds fascinating, but if I don\u2019t care about Fortnite or rich companies suing each other, what\u2019s in it for me?\n\nThe future of Google\u2019s app store could depend on this trial \u2014 both Epic and Google agree on that. Epic wants to break up Google\u2019s alleged monopoly on Android app stores and payment methods, so developers aren\u2019t stuck paying the \u201cGoogle Tax\u201d or passing that fee along to you.\n\nBut if Epic wins \u2014 according to Google, anyhow \u2014 it could make Android phones less safe by dismantling basic protections against sideloaded apps, and damage Android\u2019s ability to compete with the iPhone because it (arguably) can\u2019t run a competitive app store by giving it away for free.\n\nOr maybe you just want juicy dirt on both companies? More on that later!\n\nWhat exactly is Epic claiming?\n\nEpic argues that Google makes it so difficult for developers and users to get around its Android app store, and that app store\u2019s standard fees, that it\u2019s created an illegal monopoly that unjustly enriches Google while artificially driving up app prices because other stores can\u2019t compete.\n\nEpic also claims that Google is illegally tying its Google Play payments platform to the Google Play app store, keeping other potential app payment mechanisms from competing as well.\n\nSo, does Google have a monopoly?\n\nA monopoly on what? That\u2019s one of the biggest questions the court will decide. Epic claims that Google has illegal monopolies in \u201cAndroid app distribution\u201d and \u201cAndroid in-app payment processing.\u201d It\u2019ll argue that if you buy or develop for Android phones, you\u2019re stuck paying the Google tax.\n\nBut Google will say the real competition is from Apple, because people can choose to buy an iPhone instead. It\u2019s pretty tough to argue Google has a monopoly on app stores in general.\n\nThis whole line of argument is called \u201cmarket definition.\u201d If the court decides the relevant market is phones and app stores, not specifically Android ones, then Google\u2019s on the road to victory. If it accepts that Android apps are their own market, Epic will be in better shape. Or, it could pick a different market definition entirely, like the judge in the Apple case ended up doing.\n\nLooking at this from a less academic perspective, it\u2019s worth noting that Google charges up to ten times more per transaction than you pay with PayPal or a credit card, which does seem like a lot! And though Epic can\u2019t argue it in court, I\u2019ll point out that Apple wasn\u2019t able to explicitly justify a 30 percent fee to that case\u2019s judge.\n\nOn the other hand, it does kinda seem like Epic wants something for nothing! As far as I can tell, Epic hasn\u2019t stated what kind of fee would actually be reasonable for Google to charge in exchange for placement in Google\u2019s store \u2014 instead, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney seemingly suggests there shouldn\u2019t be a Google fee at all if a developer wants to use its own payment system.\n\nHow did Epic\u2019s argument fare against Apple?\n\nWell\u2026 both sides lost! But Epic arguably lost more. Even though Apple has incredible power over the iPhone, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled the company didn\u2019t have an unfair monopoly in this case \u2013 partly because she decided the relevant market for Fortnite was \u201cdigital mobile gaming transactions\u201d rather than, say, iPhone apps. She also decided that Epic violated its developer agreement with Apple and would have to pay.\n\nBut she also barred Apple from keeping iPhone users in the dark about alternate ways they can pay for apps \u2013 and may have even allowed developers to add their own payment mechanisms. I won\u2019t dwell on the Apple ruling, as I\u2019m ethically bound, but my colleague Adi Robertson has a comprehensive breakdown.\n\nHow can Epic possibly have a case against Google when Apple already won?\n\nEpic declined to answer this on the record, among other questions we asked... but three things to consider:\n\n1) That was a different case. Also, that one\u2019s not over till the Supreme Court weighs in or declines to take a look.\n\n2) Google can\u2019t tell jurors that Apple won its case, or that other plaintiffs settled. The judge in this case says so!\n\n3) Oh, and by the way, this is a jury trial.\n\nWait, why does that matter?\n\nEpic and Google have to convince a jury, not the judge, which is totally different from how the Apple case played out. (That one was a \u201cbench trial.\u201d)\n\nMaybe all the evidence of tricky deals inside Google might sway a jury against the company? Maybe Google scaremongering that sideloaded apps equal gaping security holes will sway a jury against Epic instead? Who knows!\n\n(If you\u2019re a Epic juror reading this \u2014 stop! Judge Donato explicitly said you\u2019re in a \u201cnews-free bubble\u201d through mid-December, folks.)\n\nDidn\u2019t other parties sue Google too?\n\nThey did! And then, they all settled. All 50 state attorneys general and a number of consumers have tentatively settled with Google over app store antitrust claims, though it\u2019s not clear what the deal might include.\n\nMatch Group, the company behind Tinder, Match.com, OkCupid and other dating apps, just reached a surprise last-minute settlement too, one that makes it sound like Match effectively gave up.\n\nEpic stands alone.\n\nCould we get a settlement between Google and Epic as well?\n\nEpic seems to have no interest in settling as long as the \u201cGoogle tax\u201d exists, and the company\u2019s repeatedly said it\u2019s not interested in cash. So far, the company\u2019s been willing to push these cases all the way through multiple appeals, cost be damned.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what Google could proactively offer that would satisfy Epic, since CEO Tim Sweeney has also publicly suggested that Google would simply circumvent any settlement it offers.\n\nBut if you do want to see a vision of a future that Epic would accept, look no further than this letter it sent to state attorneys general \u2014 laying out a settlement that would basically prohibit Google from doing the anticompetitive things that Epic claims it did.\n\nThere\u2019s also this tweet from Sweeney:\n\nGoogle wouldn\u2019t tell The Verge if it\u2019s offered Epic any kind of settlement yet.\n\nWhy if I just want the dirty laundry on both these companies? You promised dirt...\n\nOh, it could get good.\n\nThe allegations made before trial suggest Google was playing loads of dirty tricks with names like \u201cProject Hug,\u201d \u201cProject Agave,\u201d and \u201cProject Banyan\u201d, with Epic claiming it\u2019s seen evidence Google was paying off game developers and phone makers not to abandon its app store \u2014 to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. Google allegedly even toyed with the idea of buying Epic to keep Fortnite from inspiring other game developers to abandon ship.\n\nPlus, there\u2019s evidence Google deleted potentially incriminating messages to keep them out of a court\u2019s hands. Enough that the judge has decided to explicitly tell the jury we\u2019re not seeing all the evidence, because Google employees all the way up to CEO Sundar Pichai were caught setting those conversations to auto-delete. This issue has come up in the US v. Google antitrust trial in Washington, DC \u2014 still ongoing at the start of Epic\u2019s trial \u2014 as well.\n\nAnd the dirt isn\u2019t all on Google\u2019s side. Epic was caught straight-up admitting it premeditated the whole plan to bypass Google\u2019s payment systems. Since Google is countersuing over that, it could be a big deal.\n\nWhen you say \u201cstraight-up admitting...\u201d\n\nHere is an email from Epic CEO Tim Sweeney that, I think, speaks for itself:\n\n\u201cHere is our official plan for communicating with Google about bypassing the Google Play Store: SAY NOTHING TILL IT SHIPS\u201d Image via Epic v. Apple\n\nWe\u2019ll have a whole cast of intriguing people called as witnesses during the trial who might dish even more.\n\nWho will Epic and Google call as witnesses?\n\nWe are going straight to the top of the org chart, folks. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Epic CEO Tim Sweeney are absolutely expected to attend. Android co-founder Andy Rubin might be deposed, and Google says we\u2019ll hear from current Android (and Chrome, and Chrome OS) boss Hiroshi Lockheimer. Google also tells us representatives from Apple, Netflix, Motorola, and AT&T should testify as well.\n\nHow much hypocrisy can we expect in the courtroom?\n\nI\u2019d say quite a bit! For example:\n\nEpic says it\u2019s not in this for the money, it\u2019s only suing to end Google\u2019s monopoly \u2014 but Epic would surely profit if it doesn\u2019t have to pay Google\u2019s cut.\n\nIt looks like Epic\u2019s going to argue that you\u2019re locked into Android after buying an Android phone, but I can personally attest that switching back and forth between the platforms is easier than ever.\n\nGoogle will say that every Samsung Galaxy phone has \u201ca competing app store right there on the homescreen,\u201d even though Google apparently tried to quash that store, too, fearing it could cost the company billions.\n\nWe caught Google trying to play the China card in a pre-briefing with press, reminding us that Epic is 40 percent owned by Chinese company Tencent \u2014 even though Google itself allegedly considered teaming up with Tencent to eliminate the Epic threat. While the parties can\u2019t argue it in court, Google can attempt to subtly play the China card: \u201cGoogle may ask a witness once about Tencent\u2019s domicile,\u201d reads one of Judge Donato\u2019s orders.\n\nIn the same press briefing, Google suggested to journalists that Epic should have joined the company\u2019s \u201cUser Choice Billing\u201d program if it wanted an alternative payment system, instead of suing. But that program didn\u2019t exist until 2022, long after the lawsuit, and it only knocks 4 percentage points off Google\u2019s fee.\n\nWhen should we expect a jury verdict?\n\nJudge Donato told jurors that we\u2019re looking at roughly five weeks of trial starting November 6th and extending through early December. The schedule suggests the court will take Thanksgiving off, finish looking at all the evidence by December 4th, take a couple more days off before closing arguments, and then let jurors come to a decision.\n\n\u201cI fully expect we\u2019ll have plenty of time to reach a verdict well before the December holiday period,\u201d said Judge Donato.\n\nOkay, I\u2019m sold \u2014 how can I watch the trial unfold?"

        "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/15/news-publisher-files-class-action-antitrust-suit-against-google-citing-ais-harms-to-their-bottom-line/",
        "body": "A new class action lawsuit filed this week in the U.S. District Court in D.C. accuses Google and parent company Alphabet of anticompetitive behavior in violation of U.S. antitrust law, the Sherman Act, and others, on behalf of news publishers. The case, filed by Arkansas-based publisher Helena World Chronicle, argues that Google \u201csiphons off\u201d news publishers\u2019 content, their readers and ad revenue through anticompetitive means. It also specifically cites new AI technologies like Google\u2019s Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Bard AI chatbot as worsening the problem.\n\nIn the complaint, Helena World Chronicle, which owns and publishes two weekly newspapers in Arkansas, argues that Google is \u201cstarving the free press\u201d by sharing publishers\u2019 content on Google, losing them \u201cbillions of dollars.\u201d\n\nIn addition to new AI technologies, the suit points to Google\u2019s older question-and-answer technologies, like the \u201cKnowledge Graph\u201d launched in May 2012, as part of the problem.\n\n\u201cWhen a user searches for information on a topic, Google displays a \u2018Knowledge Panel\u2019 to the right of the search results. This panel contains a summary of content drawn from the Knowledge Graph database,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cGoogle compiled this massive database by extracting information from Publishers\u2019 websites \u2014 what Google calls \u2018materials shared across the web\u2019 \u2014and from \u2018open source and licensed databases,'\u201d it says.\n\nBy 2020, the Knowledge Graph had grown to 500 billion facts about 5 billion entities. But much of the \u201ccollective intelligence\u201d that Google tapped into was content \u201cmisappropriated from Publishers,\u201d the complaint alleges.\n\nOther Google technologies, like \u201cFeatured Snippets\u201d where Google algorithmically extracts answers from webpages, were also cited as shifting traffic away from publishers\u2019 websites.\n\nMore importantly, perhaps, is the suit\u2019s tackling of how AI will impact publishers\u2019 businesses. The problem was recently detailed in a report on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, which led with a shocking statistic. When online magazine The Atlantic modeled what would happen if Google integrated AI into search, it found that 75% of the time the AI would answer the user\u2019s query without requiring a click-through to its website, losing it traffic. This could have a major impact on publishers\u2019 traffic going forward, as Google today drives nearly 40% of their traffic, according to data from Similarweb.\n\nSome publishers are now trying to get ahead of the problem. For example, Axel Springer just this week inked a deal with OpenAI to license its news for AI model training. But overall, publishers believe they\u2019ll lose somewhere between 20-40% of their website traffic when Google\u2019s AI products fully roll out, The WSJ\u2019s report noted.\n\nThe lawsuit reiterates this concern, claiming that Google\u2019s recent advances in AI-based search were implemented with \u201cthe goal of discouraging end-users from visiting the websites of Class members who are part of the digital news and publishing line of commerce.\u201d\n\nSGE, it argues, offers web searchers a way to seek information in a conversational mode, but ultimately keeps users in Google\u2019s \u201cwalled garden\u201d as it \u201cplagiarizes\u201d their content. Publishers also can\u2019t block SGE because it uses the same web crawler as Google\u2019s general search service, GoogleBot.\n\nPlus, it says Google\u2019s Bard AI was trained on a dataset that included \u201cnews, magazine and digital publications,\u201d citing both a 2023 report from the News Media Alliance and a Washington Post article about AI training data for reference. (The Post, which worked with researchers at the Allen Institute for AI, had found that News and Media sites were the third largest category of AI training data.)\n\nThe case points to other concerns, too, like changing AdSense rates and evidence of improper spoliation of evidence on Google\u2019s part, by its destruction of chat messages \u2014 an issue raised in the recent Epic Games lawsuit against Google over app store antitrust issues, which Epic won.\n\nIn addition to damages, the suit is asking for an injunction that would require Google to obtain consent from publishers to use their website data to train its general artificial intelligence products including Google\u2019s own and those of rivals. It also asks Google to allow publishers who opt out of SGE to still show up in Google search results, among other things.\n\nThe U.S. lawsuit follows an agreement Google reached last month with the Canadian government which would see the search giant paying Canadian media for use of their content. Under the terms of the deal, Google will provide $73.5 million (100 million Canadian dollars) every year to news organizations in the country, with funds distributed based on the news outlets\u2019 headcount. Negotiations with Meta are still unresolved, though Meta began blocking news in Canada in August, in light of the pressure to pay for the content under the new Canadian law.\n\nThe case also arrives alongside the filing of the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit against Google for monopolizing digital ad technologies, and references the 2020 Justice Department\u2019s civil antitrust suit over search and search advertising (which are different markets from digital ad technologies in the more recent suit).\n\n\u201cThe anticompetitive effects of Google\u2019s scheme cause profound harm to competition, to consumers, to labor, and to a democratic free press,\u201d reads an announcement posted to the website of the law firm handling the case, Hausfeld.\n\n\u201cPlaintiff Helena World Chronicle, LLC invokes the Sherman Act and Clayton Act to seek class-wide monetary and injunctive relief to restore and ensure competition for digital news and reference publishing and set up guardrails to preserve a free marketplace of ideas in the new era of artificial intelligence,\u201d it states.\n\nA Google spokesperson offered a statement on the lawsuit, saying \u201cThis lawsuit is meritless. People have many ways to access information and news content today \u2013 through publishers\u2019 websites, dedicated apps, social media platforms, print papers and more. Google links people to publishers\u2019 websites more than 24 billion times each month \u2013 at no cost to them.\u201d\n\nThe complaint is available below.\n\nHelena World Chronicle, LLC v. Google LLC and Alphabet Inc by TechCrunch on Scribd\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This post was updated after publication with a statement provided by Google on Friday evening."

        "body": "Jerry Jones said earlier in the week that Sunday night's game would show him how the Cowboys stack up against the NFL's best.\n\nThe answer? Not very well.\n\nEverything that could go wrong for Dallas on Sunday did go wrong, in a game that confirmed a 49ers team that ended the Cowboys' season in each of the last two years remains a level above its NFC counterpart.\n\nThe 49ers carved up Dallas' defense on the opening drive, and that was a sign of what was to come. Brock Purdy threw four touchdowns in the 42-10 rout, including three to George Kittle. Christian McCaffrey scored a touchdown for a 14th consecutive game as all of San Francisco's offensive weapons got involved.\n\nMORE: Comparing stats for NFC stars Nick Bosa, Micah Parsons\n\nDefensively, the 49ers were relentless. Nobody had a larger impact than Fred Warner, who finished the night with an interception, sack and forced fumble in a swarming performance.\n\nThe Cowboys' offense looked very much like it did in last season's playoff exit -- uncomfortable and out of sorts. Dallas was sluggish through the first half of the game, and the night unraveled quickly when Dak Prescott threw three interceptions in the second half. It got out of hand so quickly that Sam Darnold entered the game for the 49ers with more than 12 minutes remaining.\n\nFor Prescott and the Cowboys, questions about whether they can get over the hump against the class of the NFC will persist. While their wins have been dominant, Dallas already sits two games behind the Eagles in the NFC East.\n\nThe 49ers are rolling right along, with all of their major offensive weapons now healthy and the defense living up to its billing as well. San Francisco, now 5-0, doesn't face a team with a winning record until Week 10, though the Browns, Vikings and Bengals are far from automatic wins for Kyle Shanahan's team.\n\nMORE: Why Brock Purdy remains one of the NFL's cheapest starting quarterbacks\n\nThe Sporting News tracked live scoring updates and highlights from \"Sunday Night Football\" between the Cowboys and 49ers. Check out all of the key moments you might have missed.\n\nCowboys vs. 49ers final score\n\n1 2 3 4 F Cowboys 0 7 3 0 10 49ers 7 14 7 14 42\n\nCowboys vs. 49ers results, highlights from 'Sunday Night Football'\n\n(All times Eastern)\n\nFinal: 49ers 42, Cowboys 10\n\n11:26 p.m. \u2014 That'll do it! The 49ers trounce the Cowboys and reassert themselves as one of the NFL's most dominant teams. Through five games, San Francisco is unbeaten.\n\n11:24 p.m. \u2014 These teams are trading possessions as the clock winds down. There was a brief skirmish officials had to break up as frustrations mount for Dallas.\n\n11:14 p.m. \u2014 A sack by Kevin Givens ends Rush's first drive of the night and sets up a Bryan Anger punt. Backups are in nearly all around for the 49ers.\n\n11:09 p.m. \u2014 Cooper Rush is in the game for the Cowboys...\n\n11:07 p.m. \u2014 Mitch Wishnowsky with an excellent punt for the 49ers, who are just trying to get through the rest of the game injury-free.\n\n11:04 p.m. \u2014 Sam Darnold has entered the game with 49ers. So, that's where we are with 12 minutes still on the clock.\n\n11:00 p.m. INTERCEPTION \u2014 So much for that. Oren Burks gets the 49ers' third interception of the night as Prescott continues to struggle against this San Francisco defense.\n\n10:59 p.m. \u2014 The Cowboys are moving the ball now, when it's a bit too late. Tony Pollard rips off a 26-yard run to finally break through.\n\n49ers 42, Cowboys 10\n\n10:53 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 And just like that, Jordan Mason runs in for another 49ers touchdown! This is ugly on all levels for the Cowboys, and Leighton Vander Esch is now down as well. 42-10, 49ers.\n\n10:52 p.m. INTERCEPTION \u2014 Fred Warner now has a sack, forced fumble and an interception tonight. A pass from Prescott is deflected into his hands, and the 49ers have another instant scoring opportunity.\n\n49ers 35, Cowboys 10\n\n10:47 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 Purdy hits Kyle Juszczyk for the 49ers' fifth touchdown of the night. That's four touchdowns for Purdy alone, and San Francisco is pouring it all on the Cowboys.\n\nEnd of third quarter: 49ers 28, Cowboys 10\n\n10:43 p.m. \u2014 San Francisco is moving the ball inch-by-inch now, and the 'Niners are a yard away from making this a 25-point game.\n\n10:38 p.m. \u2014 The 49ers are on the verge of entering the red zone after a 19-yard catch by Jauan Jennings. Purdy is up to 242 yards to go along with his three touchdowns.\n\n10:32 p.m. INTERCEPTION \u2014 Prescott heaves it downfield under pressure and it's intercepted by Tashaun Gipson. For a Cowboys team that has embarrassed a few opponents this year, they might be on the bad end of an ugly game here.\n\n49ers 28, Cowboys 10\n\n10:27 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 Not one, not two, THREE touchdowns for George Kittle. The 49ers have everything working offensively tonight, and any Kittle fantasy owners are thrilled.\n\n10:25 p.m. \u2014 Aiyuk's loss is Deebo Samuel's gain. Samuel goes 43 yards on the very next play, which tells you how automatic the 49ers' offense is right now. San Francisco is in the red zone looking to make this a three-score game.\n\n10:23 p.m. \u2014 An offensive holding call wipes out a 40-yard gain from Aiyuk. Wow. That's a momentum swing. Spencer Burford is the culprit.\n\n10:21 p.m. \u2014 The Purdy-to-Aiyuk connection continues to get stronger. Aiyuk goes for 23 yards to give the 49ers some breathing room after opening their drive with a false start.\n\n49ers 21, Cowboys 10\n\n10:17 p.m. FIELD GOAL \u2014 The 49ers' defense tightens the screws and limits Dallas to a field goal. Brandon Aubrey drills it from 50 yards out, and it's down to a 21-10 lead for San Francisco.\n\n10:13 p.m. \u2014 Prescott hits CeeDee Lamb for a big 29-yard gain. That quickly takes the Cowboys into 49ers territory to start the second half.\n\nEnd of first half: 49ers 21, Cowboys 7\n\n9:58 p.m. \u2014 San Francisco's defense is all over the Cowboys yet again. It's Dre Greenlaw's turn to sack Prescott, and Dallas is waving the white flag on the half. They'll start the second half with the ball.\n\n9:56 p.m. \u2014 49ers edge rusher Drake Jackson is walking off after requiring some medical attention on the field.\n\n9:52 p.m. \u2014 The 49ers tried to put something together, but a third down pass to Aiyuk was too low. Dallas has a minute to try and get something before halftime.\n\n9:45 p.m. \u2014 The Cowboys looked better on third down on their last drive, but Prescott's third down pass to Ferguson is short of the line to gain and ends this drive quickly. The 49ers will have a couple minutes to blow this game open before halftime.\n\n49ers 21, Cowboys 7\n\n9:38 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 McCaffrey pushes through for the touchdown. That's his 14th consecutive game finding the end zone, and it puts the 'Niners back up two scores.\n\n9:37 p.m. \u2014 Deebo Samuel takes some big hits but gets the 49ers down to the one-yard line. San Francisco is knocking on the door again.\n\n9:35 p.m. \u2014 The Cowboys had done a pretty nice job of containing McCaffrey to this point, but the former Pro-Bowler takes a screen pass for 19 yards to push the Niners to the edge of the red zone.\n\n9:31 p.m. \u2014 Aiyuk with a quick 15-yard catch to start the 49ers' drive. He's up to 35 yards on three catches.\n\n49ers 14, Cowboys 7\n\n9:27 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 KaVontae Turpin flashes his speed, gets separation, and hauls in Prescott's pass in the end zone! A perfectly drawn-up 26-yard play puts Dallas right back in this game.\n\nKaVontae Turpin shows off the wheels and gets in the end zone \ud83d\udca8 @KaVontaeTurpin\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: #DALvsSF on NBC\n\n\ud83d\udcf1: Stream on #NFLPlus https://t.co/gzzkvIRUdj pic.twitter.com/1bwEuaj5pN \u2014 NFL (@NFL) October 9, 2023\n\n9:24 p.m. \u2014 Prescott hits Jake Ferguson for a big third down conversion, and then some. That's 20 yards.\n\n9:23 p.m. \u2014 Tony Pollard has had a tough night so far, with just 10 yards on six touches.\n\n9:22 p.m. \u2014 Prescott fires a nice pass to Cooks to give the Cowboys another first down.\n\n9:20 p.m. \u2014 The Cowboys have a first down! And it only took 17+ minutes. Dallas is still operating in its own territory, but it feels like points are needed on this drive to keep the game within reach.\n\n49ers 14, Cowboys 0\n\n9:14 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 That was quick! Purdy hits Kittle after some trickery, and it's a two-score night for the tight end. 49ers lead, 14-0.\n\n9:13 p.m. \u2014 The Cowboys are forced to punt out of their own end zone after Fred Warner sacks Prescott. Warner now has a sack and a fumble. The 49ers will have strong field position.\n\n9:10 p.m. FUMBLE \u2014 Oh no again! They're trading fumbles! Jourdan Lewis takes the ball right out of McCaffrey's arms and spoils the 49ers' hopes of making this a 14-0 game.\n\nEnd of first quarter: 49ers 7, Cowboys 0\n\n9:04 p.m. \u2014 Confirmed: 49ers ball. San Francisco has an instant opportunity here.\n\n9:01 p.m. FUMBLE \u2014 Oh no! Pollard gets the ball knocked out deep in the Cowboys' own territory, and it looks like it was recovered by the 49ers. Officials are checking to make sure nobody was out of bounds, but that ball was very much out of Pollard's control. The 49ers could be set up in the red zone.\n\n8:59 p.m. \u2014 The drive completely falls apart for the 49ers. A delay of game penalty sets San Francisco back, and Christian McCaffrey is dropped for a five-yard loss on 3rd & 15. Not allowing even a field goal is a huge win for Dallas.\n\n8:56 p.m. \u2014 The 49ers are excelling on third down early in this game, and Purdy flips it to Kyle Juszczyk to keep the Niners' drive alive on 3rd & 1.\n\n8:54 p.m. \u2014 Now Kearse lines up offsides... That extends the drive for the 49ers, who aren't moving as freely as they were on that opening drive.\n\n8:50 p.m. \u2014 Jayron Kearse comes through with the Cowboys' first sack of the night, but Deebo Samuel makes up 11 of the 12 yards San Francisco needs on the next play.\n\n8:46 p.m. \u2014 There's the first catch of the night for Lamb, but he doesn't get the first down and Dak Prescott is sacked by Nick Bosa to quickly end the drive. This 49ers defense has picked up right where it left off against the Cowboys in January.\n\n8:44 p.m. \u2014 Dallas' second drive starts out with Tony Pollard getting dropped for a loss.\n\n8:40 p.m. \u2014 Big-time stop by the Cowboys' defense as Johnathan Hankins deflects Purdy's third down pass with his helmet and forces a punt.\n\n8:36 p.m. \u2014 The 49ers' defense was all over Dallas on that drive. Three plays, two incompletions, and now the Cowboys will punt it right back.\n\n49ers 7, Cowboys 0\n\n8:30 p.m. TOUCHDOWN \u2014 Purdy finds a wide open Kittle in the end zone for the score! That was a well-scripted opening drive by Kyle Shanahan, and San Francisco has an early 7-0 lead.\n\n8:27 p.m. \u2014 A little bit of chaos as Deebo Samuel drops a ball that was pretty close to being a fumble, but it's all a non-issue as Dallas is hit with an offsides penalty. The 49ers are right about in field goal range.\n\n8:25 p.m. \u2014 After a facemask penalty and a nine-yard pass to Brandon Aiyuk, the 49ers are already over midfield.\n\n8:23 p.m. \u2014 Kickoff is a bit on the later end, but we are about to get underway. The 49ers will start with the ball.\n\n8:10 p.m. \u2014 Jerry Jones said this week that this game will be a test of how the Cowboys match up with the NFL's best, as if there wasn't already pressure on Dallas to show something after the 49ers knocked them out of the playoffs in back-to-back years.\n\n7:56 p.m. \u2014 Frank Gore and Vernon Davis are in the house! A couple greats from the 49ers' last golden era under Jim Harbaugh.\n\nFrank Gore and Vernon Davis in the building for SNF \ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/XMKgK4aeaF \u2014 OurSF49ers (@OurSf49ers) October 8, 2023\n\n7:36 p.m. \u2014 CeeDee Lamb is coming off back-to-back games with only four catches. Is he due for a huge performance tonight?\n\n7:11 p.m. \u2014 New 49ers acquisition Randy Gregory is officially inactive against his former team.\n\n7:01 p.m. \u2014 The Eagles are going to win in Los Angeles, so the 49ers need a win to keep pace atop the NFC. After they had to play the last two NFC championship games on the road, the No. 1 seed is undoubtedly in the back of their minds.\n\n6:45 p.m. \u2014 The run of great prime-time weather continues, as it's set to be in the high 70s and sunny in Santa Clara tonight. No excuses for these powerful offenses.\n\nWhat channel is Cowboys vs. 49ers on today?\n\nGame: Cowboys vs. 49ers\n\nCowboys vs. 49ers Date: Sunday, Oct. 8\n\nSunday, Oct. 8 TV channel: NBC\n\nNBC Live stream: Peacock | NBCSports.com | Fubo (U.S.) | DAZN (Canada)\n\nCowboys vs, 49ers can be watched on NBC, which has long held the broadcast rights to \"Sunday Night Football.\"\n\nMike Tirico (play-by-play) and Cris Collinsworth (color analyst) will be on the call from Levi's Stadium while Melissa Stark will serve as the sideline reporter.

        "body": "Your time is precious, and your options are endless. The good news: We watch it all so you don\u2019t have to. Polygon\u2019s What to Watch highlights the best, the funniest, the scariest, and the most exciting in movies, TV, and everything in between. Stop scrolling, start watching!\n\nFor some reason \u2014 blame the encroaching winter, post-Halloween boredom, or simple copycat syndrome, you be the judge \u2014 November has become a big month for annual social-media-based collective challenges. From NaNoWriMo and NaPoWriMo to Movember and No-Shave November to, um, others, the extremely online crowd has focused on November as a month for group events and group discussion.\n\nFor cinephiles, the fun one of the batch is Noirvember, a collective urge to watch and compare noir movies. Unlike most of these other challenges, Noirvember doesn\u2019t have an organizing website, a sponsor, a fundraising goal, or an established set of rules. (Though individual participants have certainly proposed some.) So for those participating \u2014 or for anyone looking for the best noir movies, or the best way to get into the classic genre for the first time \u2014 we\u2019re offering a little help. Here are some of our favorites, for newbies and noir veterans alike.\n\nThe classics\n\nLet\u2019s start with a few seminal noirs, the basics you\u2019ll want to hit to understand the genre and its conventions.\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (1941)\n\nDirector: John Huston\n\nWhere to watch: Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, Apple, YouTube\n\nProbably the most famous noir movie of all time, John Huston\u2019s adaptation of Dashiell Hammett\u2019s 1930 crime movie covers the basics: There\u2019s a hard-bitten detective, Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart), on a case full of twists, turns, and double-crosses; a beautiful woman who lures him in and turns out to be full of lies; and a McGuffin everyone\u2019s after that turns out to be more than it seems. A prime example of a noir that\u2019s more about atmosphere, cinematography, and a complicated plot than about edge-of-the-seat thrills, The Maltese Falcon is a moody movie with a lot of great performances, but it\u2019s also one of those films that\u2019s been imitated and iterated on so much that it can feel a bit basic in comparison to its followers. Still, that also makes it one of those movies where watching it suddenly makes a thousand later cultural references and media in-jokes make sense. \u2014Tasha Robinson\n\nSunset Boulevard (1950)\n\nDirector: Billy Wilder\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming on Paramount Plus, and free with a library card on Hoopla or Kanopy. Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, YouTube\n\nStarting with one of the all-time great openings \u2014 has-been writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) wearily narrating over a shot of the police examining his floating corpse in a Los Angeles swimming pool \u2014 Sunset Boulevard is a stunner from start to finish. This one isn\u2019t a crime procedural, like so many classic noirs; it\u2019s about how Joe, out of work and fleeing the men trying to repossess his car, tries to find shelter with an aging movie star by promising to write her a comeback vehicle. He gets drawn into a drama he didn\u2019t expect \u2014 a drama that\u2019s exceptionally well acted and scripted. It\u2019s dark stuff about Hollywood dreams and how they die, with Gloria Swanson at her most captivating and frightening. \u2014TR\n\nDouble Indemnity (1944)\n\nDirector: Billy Wilder\n\nWhere to watch: Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, YouTube\n\nAnother Billy Wilder movie told in flashback, Double Indemnity is one of the great genre-defining femme fatale movies, with Barbara Stanwyck as the lovely lady leading hapless chump Fred MacMurray into an insurance fraud scheme that involves murdering her husband. It\u2019s one of the great twist movies \u2014 everybody in this film is a potential double-crosser, and MacMurray as an insurance investigator is both tasked with solving the murder he committed and trying to cover it up at the same time. There\u2019s enough going on here to keep anyone guessing up to the last minute. \u2014TR\n\nMore in this category: Le Samoura\u00ef, Rififi, Laura, The Third Man, Touch of Evil, The Big Sleep, In a Lonely Place, Chinatown, Night of the Hunter\n\nNext steps\n\nWhere to go after the basics? This is where noir fans\u2019 mileage is going to vary most, based on which aspects of noir they like most. The mysteries? The fraught relationships? The twisty stories and unexpected reveals? Just the overall mood? Here are a few we\u2019d recommend regardless of which subgenre you\u2019re most into.\n\nM (1931)\n\nDirector: Fritz Lang\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming on Max, The Criterion Channel, free with ads on Plex, and free with a library card on Kanopy. Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, Apple\n\nOne of the most chilling crime dramas ever put to film, M has an unbeatable premise: When a child murderer starts haunting the streets of Berlin and the police can\u2019t find him, the local crime bosses join forces to bring him down. Something like a proto version of The Wire, jumping back and forth from the police perspective to the criminals\u2019 side of things and humanizing people on both sides, M is a procedural with several unusual turns, built around a particularly memorable Peter Lorre performance. It\u2019s also absolutely packed with breathtaking shots and exceptional use of light and dark, and the final manhunt sequence is a classic all-timer. \u2014TR\n\nNotorious (1946)\n\nDirector: Alfred Hitchcock\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming free with ads on Tubi, IndieFlix, FlixFling\n\nAlfred Hitchcock\u2019s Rebecca is a defining noir classic, but fans who haven\u2019t dug past his topline roundup of classics shouldn\u2019t miss the memorable Notorious, a thriller-romance featuring some of his most touching character work. Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman), the daughter of a German war criminal, is asked to use that connection to seduce and spy on a prominent Nazi figure (Claude Rains) for the American government.\n\nIn the thinking of the time, this involves ruining herself for good men like her handler and love interest (Cary Grant) by having sex with another man. In modern eyes, this looks like the stuff anime romance dramas and fanfic are made of: Deferring her own desires for her country, Alicia willingly enters a love triangle and invites plenty of tsundere. Will duty win over love? Will she get any good spying done? Is Cary Grant the biggest self-righteous stuffed shirt imaginable in this movie? Bring on the feels. \u2014TR\n\nMore in this category: Strangers on a Train, Ace in the Hole, Murder My Sweet, The Asphalt Jungle, The Killing, The Set-Up, Scarlet Street\n\nDigging deep\n\nFollow anyone on social media who\u2019s been at the Noirvember game for a while, and you\u2019ll see plenty in this category: titles that lack a Billy Wilder or Humphrey Bogart to bring them into the cinematic limelight, but that have plenty of their own memorable charms. Here are a few we recommend for noir fans who\u2019ve seen everything else.\n\nDetour (1945)\n\nDirector: Edgar G. Ulmer\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming on Prime Video, Criterion Channel, free with ads on Pluto TV or Plex, and free with a library card on Kanopy\n\nEdgar G. Ulmer was a prolific director in the Classic Hollywood era and directed the groundbreaking psychological thriller The Black Cat, the first movie to star horror legends Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff. It was a huge hit for Universal. But Ulmer was blacklisted from most Hollywood studios shortly after, when his affair with the wife of Universal studio head Carl Laemmle\u2019s nephew turned into a divorce and remarriage.\n\nThis is all necessary context for Detour, one of many micro-budget movies Ulmer made for Producers Releasing Corporation, the smallest of the Hollywood studios at the time. It\u2019s also a standout example of film noir aesthetics and low-budget moviemaking.\n\nDetour is about a down-on-his-luck young man hitchhiking from New York to Los Angeles to meet up with his love, who moved to Hollywood with the hopes of making it big. Along the way, he meets a mysterious stranger who upends everything.\n\nDetour\u2019s tiny budget gives the 66-minute film an odd aura, with sparse sets and back projection that is inconsistent at best. But the thing undoubtedly works \u2014 it\u2019s a haunting movie about the unluckiest man in the universe, and Ulmer\u2019s striking images (and an unforgettable performance by Ann Savage) through his evocative use of lighting paint a stark picture of an uncaring world. \u2014Pete Volk\n\nSudden Fear (1952)\n\nDirector: David Miller\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming free with ads on Tubi, and free with a library card on Kanopy. Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, Apple\n\nIf you\u2019ve never seen young Jack Palance and his startling cheekbones in a \u201950s movie, this crime-and-seduction drama is worth it for that alone. But the real star of the show is Joan Crawford, in a particularly fantastic performance as a successful, wealthy playwright who winds up on both ends of a revenge scheme. When Myra Hudson (Crawford) boots handsome leading actor Lester Blaine (Palance) off her latest play because she doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s convincing as a romantic lead, and then he \u201cjust happens\u201d to run into her, seduce her, and get her to fall for him, sharp viewers will think they know where this story is going. But that\u2019ll only get them one twist down the magnificently curvy road in this movie. It\u2019s another \u201ceveryone\u2019s a potential double-crosser\u201d story, directed with surprising style and a few winks at a noir-savvy audience. \u2014TR\n\nBorn to Kill (1947)\n\nDirector: Robert Wise\n\nWhere to watch: Rentable on Amazon, Vudu\n\nAn openly Hitchcockian drama that feels like a matchup for Suspicion, Born to Kill does some particularly terrific plotting around the idea that it\u2019s always exciting when the audience knows a lot more than the characters. Helen and Sam (Claire Trevor and Lawrence Tierney) are involved in different ways with the same double murder, but don\u2019t realize it. When they meet and are attracted to each other, viewers will see the threat looming ahead even when both characters are oblivious. More murder, blackmail, cover-ups, and a great deal of double-dealing follow, enough to require a scorecard to follow the action. It\u2019s a terrifically tense story where there\u2019s no mystery about who did the killing, just about what or who audiences should root for. Do these two crazy kids have a future together? Does either deserve a future at all? And how many innocent bystanders are they going to take down with them? \u2014TR\n\nLured (1947)\n\nDirector: Douglas Sirk\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming free with a library card on Hoopla or Kanopy, and free with ads on Roku. Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, YouTube\n\nFor people only familiar with Lucille Ball as a comedian, this strange crime thriller is a particular blast. American in London Sandra Carpenter (Ball) is working as a taxi dancer when a friend of hers disappears, possibly the victim of a serial killer who\u2019s sending odd little poems to the police with every murder. The police ask Sandra to act as bait for the killer, which sends her on a bizarre, sometimes darkly hilarious tour of seedy London, as she answers lonely hearts ads and goes out to meet a series of strangers with the expectation that every one might be a murderer.\n\nBall is touchingly open-hearted in this movie, as a civilian who decides early on that she\u2019s a hard-bitten cop like so many other noir protagonists. But this isn\u2019t a satire or comedy \u2014 it\u2019s more in the mode of M than The Naked Gun, with the focus on the noose tightening around the killer, and the sense that anyone Sandra meets could be a harmless kook or a deadly predator. \u2014TR\n\nMurder by Contract (1958)\n\nDirector: Irving Lerner\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming free with ads on Tubi\n\nMurder by Contract is a lean, mean noir that had a big influence on Martin Scorsese. The director has listed it as one of his guilty pleasure movies \u2014 calling it the film that influenced him the most, especially in Taxi Driver. \u201cThe film puts us all to shame with its economy of style,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMurder By Contract was a favorite of neighborhood guys who didn\u2019t know anything about movies. They just liked the film because they recognized something unique about it.\u201d\n\nIn Murder by Contract, Vince Edwards plays a methodical hitman who is asked to kill a witness in a high-profile case. When he finds out his target is a woman, he bucks \u2014 not on moral grounds, but because women are harder to kill, due to how \u201cunpredictable\u201d they are.\n\nIrving Lerner directs the movie masterfully on a minimal budget: It\u2019s a tight 81 minutes, aided by Edwards\u2019 fantastic performance in the leading role and a great all-guitar score from Perry Botkin. Catch up with a movie that inspired some of the greats, and learn more about film history in the process \u2014 all while having a great time. \u2014PV\n\nMore in this category: Force of Evil, Nocturne (1946), Female Jungle, Killer\u2019s Kiss, Abandoned (1949), No Man of Her Own, Nightmare Alley (1947)\n\nThe neo-noirs\n\nSearch for \u201cbest neo-noirs\u201d online, and you\u2019ll get a thousand movies with dubious-at-best noir connections \u2014 practically all it takes to get a movie labeled as neo-noir is a voice-over, a procedural plot with a lot of night shots, or a downbeat ending. But there are plenty of movies that update the genre squarely and fairly, with an eye toward all the core conventions and the flavor that made noir such a memorable genre in the first place. Here are some of the best and most high-fidelity neos.\n\nThe Last Seduction (1994)\n\nDirector: John Dahl\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming on Peacock or free with ads on Tubi, Vudu, Roku, FreeVee, and Plex. Rentable at Amazon, Vudu, Apple\n\nOne of the most gleefully cruel, shockingly dirty neo-noirs to ever claim the name, The Last Seduction is a series of surprises that feels all the more subversive because the femme fatale is the protagonist, and there is no hero worth the label. Bridget Gregory (Linda Fiorentino) schemes with her patsy husband, Clay (Bill Pullman), to get her hands on a pile of illicit cash. Then she runs off with it and leaves him behind to take the fall. But she winds up stranded in a small town with time to kill and a second patsy to play with. This one gets particularly ugly by the end \u2014 it\u2019s a dark, dark story \u2014 but there\u2019s still a gleeful joy in the tightness of this narrative, and in Bridget\u2019s sociopathic skill at coming up with a manipulation for every situation. \u2014TR\n\nBlood Simple (1984)\n\nDirectors: Joel Coen and Ethan Coen\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming on Max and The Criterion Channel. Rentable at Amazon, Vudu, Alamo, YouTube\n\nFrances McDormand\u2019s screen debut and the Coen brothers\u2019 first movie is a must-see for neo-noir fans \u2014 the kind of tightly plotted, intensely acted, strikingly stylish movie they\u2019d continue to be known for in the decades that followed. It was a memorable debut for all concerned. A Texas woman (McDormand) cheats on her thuggish husband (Dan Hedaya), who sets out to kill her and her lover. But everyone involved seems to have a hidden agenda, and the threads get pretty tangled as they all come to the surface, with twist after twist making the action memorable. Blood Simple puts the visual darkness implied in \u201cnoir\u201d to particularly good work: It\u2019s the kind of movie where someone is always either lurking in deep shadow or forced off into a symbolic darkness that they might or might not come back from alive. \u2014TR\n\nBrick (2005)\n\nDirector: Rian Johnson\n\nWhere to watch: Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, Redbox\n\nFor fans: possibly the best ever neo-noir not made by the Coen brothers. For detractors: a weird \u201cIs this serious or satire?\u201d experience built around a mannered, oddball script that reduces noir to a literal high school teen drama. (Actually, the fans might agree with every part of that second description, and just mean it much more positively.)\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt stars as the hard-bitten PI equivalent, a high school kid devoted to a girl who jilted him, then turned up dead. Johnson\u2019s script (presaging his later, equally complex murder mysteries Knives Out and Glass Onion) treats high school drama like big-time drama, and puts Dashiell Hammett-style dialogue in the mouths of modern teenagers, for an effect that\u2019s a wee bit comedic and a whole lot of fun. This one\u2019s full of fun surprises, but it also respects the genre and plays fair by noir fans rather than subverting the classics. \u2014TR\n\nBad Times at the El Royale (2018)\n\nDirector: Drew Goddard\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming free with ads on FreeVee. Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, YouTube\n\nA star-studded, charisma-packed murder-thriller told out of order, in the kind of layered \u201cand here\u2019s what was going on with this other character at the same time\u201d narrative that hangs plenty of Chekhovian guns on the wall for the final act, Bad Times at the El Royale is an underrated blast. Featuring Cynthia Erivo in a star-making role, Chris Hemsworth in a part that makes the most of his sex appeal, and plenty of other familiar names (Jon Hamm, Dakota Johnson, Nick Offerman, Jeff Bridges) doing what they do, this one\u2019s a powder keg of a movie that assembles a motley crew of unrelated guests (or are they?) at a seedy motel, then keeps revealing secrets in a deliriously dizzy way as it all comes together. \u2014TR\n\nTwilight (1998)\n\nDirector: Robert Benton\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming free with a library card on Hoopla. Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, YouTube\n\nNo, not that Twilight. There isn\u2019t a sparkle-vampire in sight in this celebrity-crammed, steamy crime drama. But if you have a Noirvember buddy or viewing group, we recommend springing this on them at the last minute: \u201cHey, we\u2019re watching Twilight tonight!\u201d If they don\u2019t break your neck and throw you under a train, Double Indemnity-style, they\u2019ll probably thank you after watching this one, a surprisingly winning (and winningly surprising) crime drama starring Paul Newman, Susan Sarandon, Gene Hackman, Reese Witherspoon, Stockard Channing, James Garner, Giancarlo Esposito, Liev Schreiber, Margo Martindale, M. Emmet Walsh\u2026 It\u2019s the kind of movie where you can play \u201cOh wow, they\u2019re in this movie too?\u201d in almost every scene. \u2014TR\n\nMore in this category: Bound, Fargo, Lost Highway, U-Turn, Body Heat, The Drowning Pool, Memento, Shutter Island, Blade Runner, Nightmare Alley (2021)"

Even with a young roster and potential load management, Wembanyama's undeniable impact is evident.\n\nHis elite defense, highlighted by his 7-foot-4 height and 8-foot wingspan, allows him to dominate where others can't. Offensively, his agility and skill set are unparalleled for his size. If he refines his shooting and continues to adapt to the Spurs' style, as seen in his impressive NBA preseason performance, he'll be a force to reckon with.\n\nScoot Henderson: The Portland Trail Blazers have restructured, placing Henderson as Damian Lillard's successor. Supported by talents such as Anfernee Simons and Jerami Grant, much of the Blazers' fortunes hinge on Henderson.\n\nAfter a stellar season with the G League Ignite, expectations for his rookie year are soaring. Known for his strength and agility, and with a promising defense, Henderson is set to become a fan favorite.\n\nChet Holmgren: The Oklahoma City Thunder anticipate a strong season, largely due to Holmgren.

But you\u2019ll be doing so without much information that could be key in making an educated decision.\n\nConversely, if you wait for the data you need for an informed bet, the odds will tighten up, and you will see less of a return on your wager.\n\nWhen the lines are first released for NBA ROTY honors, the season hasn\u2019t even started yet, so there are no statistics, trends, or player news. The pre-season odds are so favorable because even the oddsmakers don\u2019t have the data to craft more specific lines.\n\nOnce the season has started and you get to see how the various rookies are performing, you can gather the relevant data. But sportsbooks are also gathering this information, and they begin to tighten the NBA Rookie of the Year lines in response.\n\nSo, while you can better guess which player will hoist the Wilt Chamberlain Trophy, the odds will be tighter, and your potential return on your wager will be reduced.\n\nPros and cons of betting early on the NBA Rookie of the Year:\n\nPros:\n\nYou have an opportunity to find better value.\n\nThe betting odds are fresh and haven't been adjusted.\n\nCons:\n\nThere is a much higher risk as a player's performance, health, and team dynamic can change throughout the season.\n\nYou\u2019ll find limited information to make an informed bet.\n\nPros and cons of waiting to bet on the NBA Rookie of the Year:\n\nPros:\n\nThere is a lot more information available to make an informed bet.\n\nYou don\u2019t risk betting on a player not remotely in contention.\n\nCons:\n\nThere is a reduced opportunity to find value.\n\nThe odds may not be as favorable.\n\nKeep in mind that it\u2019s always important to take into consideration your risk tolerance while you weigh the potential rewards. No matter when you decide to make your wager, always gather as much information as possible before risking your hard-earned money.\n\nWho are the past NBA ROTY winners?\n\nFor context, here is a list of the National Basketball Association Rookie of the Year winners since 2010.\n\nSeason Player Position Team 2023 Paolo Banchero Forward Orlando Magic 2022 Scottie Barnes Forward Toronto Raptors 2021 LaMelo Ball Guard Charlotte Hornets 2020 Ja Morant Guard Memphis Grizzlies 2019 Luka Don\u010di\u0107 Guard/Forward Dallas Mavericks 2018 Ben Simmons Forward/Guard Philadelphia 76ers 2017 Malcolm Brogdon Guard Milwaukee Bucks 2016 Karl-Anthony Towns Center Minnesota Timberwolves 2015 Andrew Wiggins Forward/Guard Minnesota Timberwolves 2014 Michael Carter-Williams Guard Philadelphia 76ers 2013 Damian Lillard Guard Portland Trail Blazers 2012 Kyrie Irving Guard Cleveland Cavaliers 2011 Blake Griffin Forward Los Angeles Clippers 2010 Tyreke Evans Guard/Forward Sacramento Kings\n\nWhat other NBA futures can I bet on?\n\nRookie of the Year is not the only form of NBA futures betting. Legal online sportsbooks have a wide selection of NBA futures you can bet on, including:\n\nIn addition to futures bets, you can wager on many NBA bets during the regular season and postseason. NBA game lines (moneylines, point spreads, and totals) are the most popular, but you\u2019ll also be able to bet on NBA team and player props, parlays, and more.\n\nThe NBA is the second-most popular odds market to bet on in the US, behind NFL betting odds. That means every online betting site always has a great selection of NBA odds."

After a surprising loss to the Jets in Week 6 (their first of the season), Philadelphia went on a five-game winning streak, impressively taking down top teams like the Dolphins, Cowboys and Chiefs. Most of those games were gritty, close wins, but then the Eagles dropped back-to-back games in blowout fashion to the 49ers and Cowboys, raising alarm bells amongst the Philly fanbase.\n\nThe Eagles are looking to rebound against a Seahawks team that has been reeling even worse, losing four straight. Sitting four games behind the 49ers in the NFC West, despite a disappointing season, Seattle still has a shot at a wild card playoff spot. After tonight\u2019s game, the Seahawks\u2019 schedule eases up a bit, with winnable games against the Titans, Steelers and Cardinals. But they could really use a victory to give them some confidence going into the final stretch.\n\nPicks to consider"

        "body": "Travis Kelce has been catching a lot more than footballs lately, and fans everywhere have been swift to hop on the Taylor Swift bandwagon. The celebrity couple has been in the news for well over a week now, and despite the fatigue from many -- Chris 'Mad Dog' Russo's rant being among the most vocal -- companies like FanDuel just can't help but lean into a profitable storyline. Are they for real or is this \"Love Story\" just some extravagant publicity stunt?\n\nTime will tell, but one thing's for certain when it comes to the media, social media, newspapers, football fans, Swifties, and just about everyone else within the 50 states and U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico and Guam: \"You need to calm down.\" Regardless, Kelce and Swift take their tour on the road to Broadway, a place that puts on all the great shows. The traditional circus hasn't been in town for a few years now, but that's simply because the New York Jets exist and there was only room for one. It seems like ages since Aaron Rodgers marched out of the MetLife Stadium tunnel holding an American flag, but this is Zach Wilson's team now, whether you like it or not.\n\nOne of the most hyped \"Sunday Night Football\" games of the year was expected to feature Rodgers against Patrick Mahomes for the first time. Instead, we're more likely to be treated to non-stop split screens involving Swift and Rodgers, two people who won't be on the field. There will be some actual football, though, even if it is just a sideshow to the event everyone can't stop talking about. So, buckle up and enjoy whatever this is, and for all the fans paying ridiculous prices for a glimpse of Ms. Swift \u2014 make sure your phone is charged.\n\nTo Travis and Taylor, \"Welcome to New York.\" It's been waiting for you. Well, actually, the swamps of northern New Jersey have. Enjoy the traffic and a look at the famous skyline.\n\nFor bettors, where there is hype, there's also an opportunity to make some money. FanDuel has released a special prop bets menu, cleverly called \"Prop Stars\" for the Swift-inspired wagers. Here's a look at how you can catch some cash in prime time.\n\nMORE: Jets vs. Chiefs betting preview\n\nFanDuel 'Prop Stars' Picks: Best bets for Travis Kelce & Taylor Swift-inspired props for Chiefs-Jets Week 4\n\nTop of the Charts: Travis Kelce to have the Most Receiving Yards in the Game (+140)\n\nThe Jets know that Kelce is trouble long before he even walks in. If they want any chance in this game, they'll have to slow down No. 87. This is a New York defense that's been very good, although not quite great, over the last year and continues to improve. Robert Saleh's troops have held opponents in check, giving their anemic offense a fighting chance most weeks, but if there's one thing that Gang Green struggles to defend against, it's the tight end. They're giving up the fifth-most receiving yards to the position this season (56.3) and just allowed Pharoah Brown to beat them for a long 58-yard touchdown last Sunday. Getting +140 is a nice price for the best pass-catcher in this game, but there's too much blowout potential to warrant taking a flier here.\n\nOur pick: Pass\n\nSeeing Red: Chiefs to Win by 22+ (+380)\n\nIf this bet ends up cashing, the \"Seeing Red\" tagline would apply to a lot more than just Chiefs fans. Bettors would be in the green, and those wearing green would be the ones with red-ish, cartoon-like faces. Odds are, Wilson would have to be atrocious again considering New York's defense isn't a pushover. The Jets often like to make games close, even when they seemingly have no business in doing so. Even if they are steamrolled, a garbage time score is more than enough to ruin this wager.\n\nOur pick: Pass\n\nOpening Act: Travis Kelce First TD Scorer (+400)\n\nOut of all the specials, this one is our favorite. The Chiefs will likely score first whether they get the opening kickoff or not. When we look at the Jets, we see an offensive coordinator that somehow underrated Micah Parsons and a team that refuses to take the training wheels off their former gunslinging quarterback. Wilson has turned into \"Checkdown Charlie\" as a result of conservative coaching, and we don't expect that to change in the early going. Lean into the narrative and sprinkle a little cash on Kelce to break the plane first.\n\nOur pick: Bet on it\n\nFriENDZONE: Travis Kelce to NOT score a TD (+120)\n\nObviously, based on our last recommendation, we're friendzoning this bet and not laying down any action on it.\n\nOur pick: Pass\n\nRunning Away Together: Chiefs to have 150+ Total Rushing Yards (+420)\n\nThe strength of the Jets roster is along the defensive line, and the Chiefs are a pass-first team that loves to light it up through the air. This is the first time that Patrick Mahomes is playing in the New York area. He'll want to put on a show, and Andy Reid certainly isn't going to hold him back. Don't expect the Chiefs to start running until it's time to chew the clock.\n\nOur pick: Pass\n\nSeemingly Ranch: Travis Kelce Last TD Scorer (+550)\n\nRanch is a fine condiment and beloved by many, which makes this wager something that should be seen as an insult to ranch fans everywhere. Unless the Jets make this a close game or send it to overtime, we have a hard time believing that Kelce will even be on the field to score the last touchdown. Avoid this one like people with taste buds avoid bleu cheese and treat your nuggets with respect.\n\nOur pick: Pass\n\nPlot Twist: Zach Wilson to have 300+ Passing Yards (+1800)\n\nIf you asked the average Jets' fan what is holding this roster back, the overwhelming results would be Wilson. \"I'm the problem, it's me,\" would probably qualify as the lyrics played in his walk-up song if fans had anything to say about it. But Wilson doesn't have time to be the anti-hero, or villain, as traditionalists would say. He needs to flip the script and shake it off. The Jets need to let him sling the ball around the field instead of worrying about the bad turnovers. They aren't winning this game 14-10, and they aren't winning anything if they can't let their quarterback be who he is. Are we betting this? Absolutely not, but that would be one heck of a plot twist, right? Perhaps the script writers are working overtime.\n\nOur pick: Pass\n\nPlatinum Performance: Travis Kelce to Score 3+ TDs (+2500)\n\nWhen it comes to Kelce's greatest hits, he prefers to save them for division rivals like the Raiders and Chargers. In your wildest dreams this bet might hit, and it might happen in reality too. Kelce could be schmoozing in the suite when the second half begins rather than throwing blocks and catching footballs on the field. But if the Jets keep it close, they are prone to being exploited by players like Kelce. With receivers lacking on the Chiefs sideline, the tight end might put on a show that is typically only found in show business. Considering he hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d back in March, Kelce is familiar with how to tell a story. We have him scoring once, so what\u2019s another two times to cash a monster long shot? Don't count on it, but don't rule it out either. And please, have fun and bet responsibly.\n\nOur pick: Bet on it (with a small wager)\n\nExes & 0s: NY Jets to Score 0 Total Points (+3400)\n\nThe Jets are currently back in a familiar place as the laughingstock of the NFL. Swift, like many celebrities, has plenty of exes, but she always scores again. Maybe the haters are right. Maybe Kelce will be the subject of the next big hit. Maybe the publicists are cashing checks with this brilliant idea. Maybe it's real. Time will tell, but when the relationship inevitably falls apart like most dream celebrity couples do, there is always another someone. Point is, the Jets are without the quarterback they married, and now they're back together with Wilson. It's not glamorous, but they'll score again. Shutting out NFL teams is no easy task, but the Chiefs defense is much improved and the Jets look like a team that doesn\u2019t have a quarterback. Don\u2019t consider it likely to hit, but +3400 wagers hardly ever are. Consider this a fun bet, unless you\u2019re a Jets fan, and see how long K.C. can keep NYC off the scoreboard. They might just do it for the entire game.\n\nOur pick: Bet on it (with a small wager)"

        "body": "Surprise! Valve has announced a new Steam Deck and \u2014 double surprise \u2014 we\u2019ve already reviewed it. It might not look like a big change from the outside, but the Steam Deck OLED is a thorough mid-cycle refresh of a machine that\u2019s not even two years old. At the same time, Valve is also adjusting the configuration of its entry-level model, making it a far more compelling option. Apologies to anyone who literally bought a Steam Deck yesterday.\n\nAt an event held for press prior to the device's launch, Greg Coomer, a product designer at Valve, called the new model \"the definitive version of the Steam Deck.\" He explained that the device contains many things the company wanted to include at the LCD model's launch but wasn't able to, along with some additions based on community feedback.\n\nAs its name suggests, the most noticeable upgrade to the Steam Deck OLED is the display. The original Steam Deck had a 7-inch 800p LCD running at 60Hz. The new model squeezes a 7.4-inch OLED screen into the same space, significantly shrinking the bezels around the display. The new panel runs at the same resolution, but with a refresh rate of up to 90Hz. It\u2019s also HDR, covering 110 percent of the P3 color space with a peak brightness of 1,000 nits \u2014 the old model maxed out at around 400 nits. Like all OLED screens, it has pure blacks and near-instantaneous response times. As before, anti-glare etched glass is available, but only on the premium model.\n\nThe Steam Deck OLED has a die-shrunk version of the same custom APU found in the original Steam Deck. The new APU is produced on a 6nm process, rather than the older 7nm process. Manufacturers typically use die-shrinks to either improve performance or efficiency, and Valve has chosen the latter. The max frequency of both the GPU and CPU are identical between the LCD and OLED models, so for developers tuning their games for Steam Decks, they only have a single performance target.\n\nIn concert with the more-efficient processor, there\u2019s also a 25 percent larger battery with a 50Whr capacity, compared to the original\u2019s 40Whr. According to Valve, these changes combined result in a 30-50 percent increase in longevity between the two generations \u2014 the official battery life claim is \"three to 12 hours.\" In our review, we measured a playtime increase of 62 percent when playing Hades on the OLED model versus our 18-month-old original. (Batteries degrade over time, which explains why our gains were more pronounced.)\n\nThe new internals make the Steam Deck OLED marginally lighter, and also cooler to the touch when playing games, aided by a slightly larger fan. Other improvements include support for both Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, together with a new antenna array that will give a better experience when using both at the same time. There\u2019s also a reworked power supply (it has a logo now!) with a longer 2.5m cable that will charge the OLED model from 20 to 80 percent in \u201cas little as 45 minutes.\u201d The thumbsticks have also been made 1mm taller, and the touch pads' haptics are slightly sharper.\n\nValve\n\nThe Steam Deck OLED starts at $549, and will replace all but the entry-level model in the range. The immediate reality is a bit of a mess and a little complicated, but this, Valve says, will be the Steam Deck line-up moving forward:\n\n256GB Steam Deck LCD ($399)\n\n512GB Steam Deck OLED ($549)\n\n1TB Steam Deck OLED ($649)\n\nAs a result of the changes, the 64GB LCD Steam Deck (previously sold at $399) will drop to $349, and the 512GB LCD (previously $649) will drop to $499. Once Valve sells through its inventory of both, those lines will be discontinued. Valve says it will continue to support all LCD models with software updates.\n\nSo, the long-term lineup starts at the same $399 price, which gets you the old LCD Steam Deck, but with 256GB of storage instead of 64GB. The new step-up model costs $20 more at $549, but comes with an OLED display and the improvements outlined above, plus double the storage. The range still tops out at $649, but you\u2019re getting a lot more for your money: All of the hardware improvements, 1TB of storage instead of 512GB and an improved carry case that can pop out into a slimmer shell that\u2019s smaller and easier to fit in a bag. As mentioned, it also has the same anti-glare etched glass as the outgoing 512GB LCD model.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s also a Limited Edition version of the 1TB model, with a translucent shell and a customized carry case, which will be sold at $679. We imagine stocks will not last very long, as it looks pretty rad:\n\nValve\n\nWhile there are no concrete updates on future hardware developments, Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais noted that, so long as interest in handheld gaming remains high, the company has \"plans for successive generations of handhelds.\" For now, Griffais explained, it's important to Valve that developers don't need to \"split their attention\" between different performance targets.\n\nWhen asked about the potential for future hardware \u2014 like a return of the Steam Machine or an updated Steam Controller \u2014 there were no firm updates, but there does seem to be something happening. Griffais agreed that enabling the Steam Deck to work as a hybrid living room console was a \"side goal\" of the team, and noted that everything Valve does to improve SteamOS will benefit other devices. Coomer added that Valve is still working internally on \"a bunch of controllers and prototypes.\" If SteamOS is being used on larger displays, the team would want to augment that experience with better input options. \"We don't have any announcements on that front, but it's why we're building prototypes and thinking about the future there,\" Coomer said.\n\nThe Steam Deck OLED will be available to order on November 16th at 1PM ET. Valve expects units to begin shipping as soon as orders start to roll in. The updated pricing on the existing LCD models is already in effect."

        "body": "In early 2022, Valve released my favorite video game console. But even I had some gripes. With the Steam Deck, I could \u2014 for the first time \u2014 play the bulk of my sprawling collection of video games wherever I\u2019d like. But I tended to bundle it with a huge portable power supply. I also couldn\u2019t quite shirk how much better games looked on our family\u2019s OLED TV.\n\nAnd yet, for me, an adult with limited time to play video games alone in a quiet room, nothing could beat the Steam Deck\u2019s freedom. Barring the occasional diversion, Valve\u2019s handheld PC had served as my preferred gaming option ever since I published our review. Then, last week, the Steam Deck OLED arrived. It\u2019s as if the Steam Deck team collected a laundry list of complaints about the original, then responded to all of them one by one.\n\nPolygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences. When we award the Polygon Recommends badge, it\u2019s because we believe the recipient is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive, or fun \u2014 and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch .\n\nIt appears, at first glance, that Valve cribbed from Nintendo\u2019s playbook with the Switch OLED, for which Nintendo upgraded the device\u2019s screen but not its guts. In terms of raw power, the Steam Deck OLED is identical to the original Steam Deck. Valve says this synchronicity is meant in part to continue to provide developers with a single goal when optimizing their games \u2014 though it promises that the Steam Deck 2 (which the company hopes to release in two to three years) will have a generational power leap.\n\nFor those who haven\u2019t tried a Steam Deck, though, I wouldn\u2019t wait for its sequel. Because while Valve hasn\u2019t upped the horsepower, it has improved practically everything else. The Steam Deck OLED has longer battery life, faster Wi-Fi, and a stand-alone Bluetooth module. And the screen isn\u2019t just OLED; it\u2019s HDR OLED \u2014 the first HDR OLED screen on any gaming portable, with a peak brightness of 1,000 nits for HDR content and 600 nits for SDR (for comparison, the original screen\u2019s peak brightness was 400 nits). And somehow, with all of these additions, the Steam Deck OLED is lighter.\n\nSo, goodbye, old Steam Deck; hello, new Steam Deck.\n\nThe Steam Deck OLED delivers on Valve\u2019s original promise\n\nOLED is in the name for a reason.\n\nThe OLED panel in the new Steam Deck is lighter, thinner, and more power efficient than its LCD predecessor. It\u2019s also bigger and faster. Though the device has the same shape as the original Steam Deck, smaller screen bezels allow for a display that\u2019s slightly larger, at 7.4 inches compared to 7 inches. The panel has a wider color gamut (110% DCI-P3, for the visual obsessives) and the beautiful, inky blacks that OLED dorks like myself adore.\n\nSteam Deck OLED\u2019s bigger, better battery Valve\u2019s promise of 30-50% more battery raised one obvious question: Is that comparing the OLED model with a Steam Deck running its original firmware (which had poor battery life), or a Steam Deck using the latest firmware? Valve\u2019s answer: the latter! So if you\u2019re a Steam Deck owner, expect those big battery improvements over your current Steam Deck experience.\n\nThe OLED panel also has a 90 Hz refresh rate \u2014 perfect for frame doubling from 45 frames per second. In case that jargon means nothing to you, suffice it to say that gameplay on the Steam Deck OLED looks smoother. The improved 90 Hz refresh rate falls short of the Asus ROG Ally\u2019s 120 Hz, though it\u2019s worth considering that the higher the frame rate, the faster the battery drain \u2014 assuming you can even spot the difference between 90 Hz and 120 Hz.\n\nYou know what\u2019s more interesting than a list of technical specs? Actually seeing the screen. It\u2019s gorgeous. On Sunday morning, I picked at Sega\u2019s Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name while watching football and Christmas movies with my family. The new Yakuza game looks fantastic on high settings at 60 fps, its night sequences flaunting the OLED\u2019s dark blacks and the abundance of neon signage showcasing the HDR.\n\nI got so distracted pulverizing bad dudes that it took me some time to notice the Steam Deck OLED\u2019s most welcome feat. When playing AAA games on the original Steam Deck, I had always kept the handheld plugged into an outlet. But with the OLED model, a couple of hours had passed before I realized I\u2019d forgotten to connect the charger.\n\nThe OLED screen makes for a fancier Steam Deck, but it\u2019s the battery life (and some tweaks throughout the design to carve out more of it) that lets Valve\u2019s new handheld truly deliver on its promise of a portable gaming PC.\n\nAll the tiny, delightful improvements of Steam Deck OLED\n\nSince the original Steam Deck launched, Valve has been improving the hardware through updates \u2014 its team estimates around 300 to date. That will continue with both the Steam Deck OLED and the original Steam Deck, the latter of which will get a fresh BIOS update to align itself with some of the former\u2019s upgrades. The original device will see some battery life improvement; just don\u2019t expect the OLED model\u2019s jump of 30-50%.\n\nSome changes \u2014 even smallish ones \u2014 demand new hardware. And so, alongside the big improvements, Valve has made a gaggle of minor physical upgrades with its new iteration. The Steam Deck OLED now includes a Wi-Fi 6E radio (great if you have a modern router and connection to make use of it) and a dedicated Bluetooth module, which allows for improved audio quality with wireless headphones, the option to wake the Steam Deck from a controller, and the capability to connect many Bluetooth controllers for multiplayer. The haptics are noticeably improved, with a wider frequency range. And the touchscreen is markedly better \u2014 it\u2019s responsive to the point where I don\u2019t feel the need to plug in a USB-C keyboard anytime I need to type a few words.\n\nA review for spec specifics If you\u2019re the sort of person who likes the nitty-gritty technical details of screens and batteries, we also recommend reading The Verge\u2019s review.\n\nValve also claims that the Steam Deck OLED is more repairable, which, mercifully, I didn\u2019t have the need to test for myself. (Parts will once again be sold through iFixit.) However, I did enjoy the new power supply, with its faster charging (45 minutes gets you from 20% to 80%) and 2.5-meter cable that stretches the length of my couch.\n\nOne small, charming detail: The carrying case now has a tinier carrying case within it. If you want to be extra cautious, stick to the original bulky case. But if you need to toss the Steam Deck in your backpack for a day trip? Go with the slim case that has funny little thumbstick nipples!\n\nAll of the tweaks, large and small, amount to a perfect handheld \u2014 made better by the price, which remains the same as the original Steam Deck available today, just that the OLED will come with more stuff. Valve will be selling three models:\n\n$649 - 1 TB OLED (up from 512 GB)\n\n$529 - 512 GB OLED (up from 256 GB)\n\n$399 - 256 GB non-OLED Steam Deck (up from 64 GB)\n\nPlus, for a limited time, the company will offer a special edition 1 TB Steam Deck OLED made with a translucent shell for $679 \u2014 only in the U.S. and Canada. Though let\u2019s be real: This thing will sell like hotcakes and Valve will reconsider the definition of \u201climited supply.\u201d Have I considered ordering one of these limited editions? Yes. But I am also practicing restraint. Like, how many Steam Decks should one human have?\n\nI suppose that\u2019s the question, really. If you already have a Steam Deck, is the OLED model technically an incremental improvement? Yes. But you might find that the screen and the battery justify the double dip. For someone like me, who puts hundreds of hours into the Steam Deck each year, the upgrade is inescapable.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t have a Steam Deck? How many times can I say it: This is my favorite console ever. And it just got better.\n\nThe Steam Deck OLED will be available Nov. 16 to purchase through the Steam storefront.

        "body": "Surprise! Valve has announced a new Steam Deck and \u2014 double surprise \u2014 we\u2019ve already reviewed it. It might not look like a big change from the outside, but the Steam Deck OLED is a thorough mid-cycle refresh of a machine that\u2019s not even two years old. At the same time, Valve is also adjusting the configuration of its entry-level model, making it a far more compelling option. Apologies to anyone who literally bought a Steam Deck yesterday.\n\nAt an event held for press prior to the device's launch, Greg Coomer, a product designer at Valve, called the new model \"the definitive version of the Steam Deck.\" He explained that the device contains many things the company wanted to include at the LCD model's launch but wasn't able to, along with some additions based on community feedback.\n\nAs its name suggests, the most noticeable upgrade to the Steam Deck OLED is the display. The original Steam Deck had a 7-inch 800p LCD running at 60Hz. The new model squeezes a 7.4-inch OLED screen into the same space, significantly shrinking the bezels around the display. The new panel runs at the same resolution, but with a refresh rate of up to 90Hz. It\u2019s also HDR, covering 110 percent of the P3 color space with a peak brightness of 1,000 nits \u2014 the old model maxed out at around 400 nits. Like all OLED screens, it has pure blacks and near-instantaneous response times. As before, anti-glare etched glass is available, but only on the premium model.\n\nThe Steam Deck OLED has a die-shrunk version of the same custom APU found in the original Steam Deck. The new APU is produced on a 6nm process, rather than the older 7nm process. Manufacturers typically use die-shrinks to either improve performance or efficiency, and Valve has chosen the latter. The max frequency of both the GPU and CPU are identical between the LCD and OLED models, so for developers tuning their games for Steam Decks, they only have a single performance target.\n\nIn concert with the more-efficient processor, there\u2019s also a 25 percent larger battery with a 50Whr capacity, compared to the original\u2019s 40Whr. According to Valve, these changes combined result in a 30-50 percent increase in longevity between the two generations \u2014 the official battery life claim is \"three to 12 hours.\" In our review, we measured a playtime increase of 62 percent when playing Hades on the OLED model versus our 18-month-old original. (Batteries degrade over time, which explains why our gains were more pronounced.)\n\nThe new internals make the Steam Deck OLED marginally lighter, and also cooler to the touch when playing games, aided by a slightly larger fan. Other improvements include support for both Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, together with a new antenna array that will give a better experience when using both at the same time. There\u2019s also a reworked power supply (it has a logo now!) with a longer 2.5m cable that will charge the OLED model from 20 to 80 percent in \u201cas little as 45 minutes.\u201d The thumbsticks have also been made 1mm taller, and the touch pads' haptics are slightly sharper.\n\nValve\n\nThe Steam Deck OLED starts at $549, and will replace all but the entry-level model in the range. The immediate reality is a bit of a mess and a little complicated, but this, Valve says, will be the Steam Deck line-up moving forward:\n\n256GB Steam Deck LCD ($399)\n\n512GB Steam Deck OLED ($549)\n\n1TB Steam Deck OLED ($649)\n\nAs a result of the changes, the 64GB LCD Steam Deck (previously sold at $399) will drop to $349, and the 512GB LCD (previously $649) will drop to $499. Once Valve sells through its inventory of both, those lines will be discontinued. Valve says it will continue to support all LCD models with software updates.\n\nSo, the long-term lineup starts at the same $399 price, which gets you the old LCD Steam Deck, but with 256GB of storage instead of 64GB. The new step-up model costs $20 more at $549, but comes with an OLED display and the improvements outlined above, plus double the storage. The range still tops out at $649, but you\u2019re getting a lot more for your money: All of the hardware improvements, 1TB of storage instead of 512GB and an improved carry case that can pop out into a slimmer shell that\u2019s smaller and easier to fit in a bag. As mentioned, it also has the same anti-glare etched glass as the outgoing 512GB LCD model.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s also a Limited Edition version of the 1TB model, with a translucent shell and a customized carry case, which will be sold at $679. We imagine stocks will not last very long, as it looks pretty rad:\n\nValve\n\nWhile there are no concrete updates on future hardware developments, Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais noted that, so long as interest in handheld gaming remains high, the company has \"plans for successive generations of handhelds.\" For now, Griffais explained, it's important to Valve that developers don't need to \"split their attention\" between different performance targets.\n\nWhen asked about the potential for future hardware \u2014 like a return of the Steam Machine or an updated Steam Controller \u2014 there were no firm updates, but there does seem to be something happening. Griffais agreed that enabling the Steam Deck to work as a hybrid living room console was a \"side goal\" of the team, and noted that everything Valve does to improve SteamOS will benefit other devices. Coomer added that Valve is still working internally on \"a bunch of controllers and prototypes.\" If SteamOS is being used on larger displays, the team would want to augment that experience with better input options. \"We don't have any announcements on that front, but it's why we're building prototypes and thinking about the future there,\" Coomer said.\n\nThe Steam Deck OLED will be available to order on November 16th at 1PM ET. Valve expects units to begin shipping as soon as orders start to roll in. The updated pricing on the existing LCD models is already in effect."

        "url": "https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-oled-review-its-just-better-180038030.html?src=rss",
        "body": "The first thing to know about the Steam Deck OLED is that it\u2019s not the Steam Deck 2. The Steam Deck OLED is a mid-cycle refresh from Valve, similar to the Switch OLED upgrade, but there\u2019s a lot more going on internally here. Its screen is better, its battery life is better, its thumbsticks are better, the haptics are better, and its chip and thermals are better. One thing that hasn\u2019t changed is its form factor \u2014 this is still one of the biggest babies on the handheld block.\n\nThe new Steam Deck\u2019s main upgrade is its OLED screen, which replaces the original LCD and, crucially, has native support for HDR and faster frame rates. The OLED also has smaller bezels, making the display larger at 7.4 inches, compared with the original 7-inch screen.\n\nValve Valve Steam Deck OLED SCORE 89 Engadget 89 Critics - Not yet scored N/A Users - Not yet scored N/A Pros Improved battery life\n\nBright and smooth visuals\n\nBetter thermals\n\nFeels less top-heavy\n\nLong charging cable Cons Still ridiculously large\n\nSeriously it\u2019s so big\n\nValve Valve Steam Deck OLED This isn't the Steam Deck 2 some are waiting for, it's just a welcome improvement on an already good device. $549 at Steam\n\nOLED screen\n\nThe HDR OLED display looks fantastic. It features a wider P3 color gamut, pure blacks and a peak brightness of 1,000 nits, compared with the original max of 400 nits. In action, this means the screen\u2019s bezels meld with the black of any game, creating a more polished frame for retro aspect ratios and providing room for higher-contrast colors. The screen on the new model doesn\u2019t support variable refresh rates (VRR), but it now tops out at 90Hz, while the original could only hit 60Hz. The updated display is smooth, crisp and bright, like a perfect lemon tart. (Even then, I do not recommend licking the screen.)\n\nBattery life\n\nOne of the downsides of the first Steam Deck was its short battery life, which maxed out at eight hours, and that was only under ideal conditions. Valve says the new Steam Deck battery will last 30 to 50 percent longer, depending on how you\u2019re playing, and it charges faster \u2014 the company claims it will go from 20 percent to 80 percent in 45 minutes.\n\nCustom AMD APU\n\nThe Steam Deck OLED has a die-shrunk version of the custom AMD APU found in the original Steam Deck \u2014 same CPU and GPU, just more efficient. This is the process Sony takes advantage of to build the PS4 Slim and PS5 Slim, but instead of collapsing the Steam Deck around smaller hardware, Valve chose to add a bigger battery and larger fan to its existing chassis. For developers, this means the device has the same performance targets as the original and there\u2019s no need to create games specifically for the new hardware. In the end, the device weighs about 30 grams less than the original model, or the equivalent of five quarters.\n\nEngadget\n\nIn use\n\nWhich leads us to the bad news for my tiny hand gang. The Steam Deck OLED is the same monstrous size as the original: 11.7 inches long, 4.5 inches tall and nearly 2 inches thick. The thumbsticks on the new model are actually 1mm taller than the first version. This was one of my main complaints about the Steam Deck when I first reviewed it: I have smaller-than-average hands, and the Steam Deck looks and feels absolutely ridiculous when I\u2019m holding it. It\u2019s just massive, no matter how long my manicure gets. However, the OLED model feels more balanced than the original. It\u2019s less top-heavy, and it does technically weigh less. These small adjustments have made a noticeable difference during my playtime, and the device feels slightly more manageable as a handheld \u2014 or maybe I\u2019m just too distracted by all of its bright, pretty colors to care about the cramping in my palms.\n\nThe thumbsticks on the new handheld have an improved texture that shouldn\u2019t turn gray after a few months\u2019 use, and they feel perfectly serviceable. In my hands-on time so far, I've found that the OLED touchscreen responds immediately to input, and the haptic feedback on the built-in trackpads feels even more precise, populating in reactive pin-pricks under the textured plastic.\n\nI spent a few cozy nights on my couch swapping between the LCD and OLED Steam Decks, and honestly, after I\u2019m done with this review, I\u2019ll probably retire my original model. The Steam Deck OLED is sharper and more responsive; indie games, AAA games and plain old Steam menus look so much better on the new hardware.\n\nEngadget\n\nHades is my most-played game on the original Steam Deck, so I used that to test out Valve\u2019s battery life claims. Though it doesn\u2019t support HDR, a game like Hades pops on the OLED, and its animations look more fluid than on the LCD version. The OLED lasted four hours and 23 minutes before dying. With the same settings (800p with a 60 fps cap and similar brightness) the original model died after two hours and 42 minutes. That\u2019s a 62 percent improvement, surpassing Valve\u2019s own estimates, though batteries degrade and I\u2019ve had my LCD Steam Deck since the device\u2019s launch in early 2022. In a stress test that involved playing Elden Ring with everything maxed out, the OLED battery lasted two hours and 20 minutes, about 40 percent longer than the original.\n\nPlaying the Steam Decks back-to-back highlighted another significant quality-of-life improvement: heat management. My palms have gotten toasty playing the OLED model, but they haven\u2019t broken a sweat like they often do with the original. The new fan may be larger, but it\u2019s not any louder, and it clearly works a treat.\n\nThe Steam Deck OLED has a new Wi-Fi 6E module and improved antennas that should enable faster downloads for anyone with a compatible router. I don\u2019t have a 6E router or multi-gigabit Wi-Fi, but with a regular Wi-Fi 6 router, the top download speed I saw on the new Steam Deck was 562mbps, which was about 10 percent faster than the old Steam Deck, and 10 percent slower than the speeds I get on my MacBook Pro. The device uses Bluetooth 5.3 and adds a dedicated antenna, which should improve functionality when using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth at the same time.\n\nEngadget\n\nEven with improvements to the battery, thermals and weight distribution, the Steam Deck OLED is still more of a Wii U than a Vita. It\u2019s a beast of a handheld, and it makes the most sense as a portable console to use around the house, rather than a truly travel-ready device. The new model even comes with an extra-long, 2.5m charging cable, designed specifically with couch-based players in mind. I didn\u2019t test out the docking station with the new Steam Deck, but Valve recently released a SteamOS update that lets players take advantage of HDR and VRR on external displays, which only drives home the Wii U-ness of it all.\n\nAs far as software, you know the drill by now. Valve has rolled out labels for Steam games signifying how well they\u2019ll work on the handheld, with four levels: unknown, unsupported, playable and verified. Playable games generally come with a small caveat, like having to deploy the on-screen keyboard, while verified games have been fully optimized for portable play. Currently, more than 10,000 titles on Steam fall under the playable or verified labels, with more added every day.\n\nWhen will the Steam Deck OLED be available?\n\nThe Steam Deck OLED will go on sale on November 16th at 1pm ET, and Valve has units ready to ship that same day. The company has lowered the price of its LCD lineup and will sell through its backstock of 64GB and 512GB models until they\u2019re all gone. It\u2019ll continue selling the 256GB LCD model at a reduced price of $400, while the 512GB OLED model will cost $550 and the 1TB OLED model will cost $650. There\u2019s also a limited edition 1TB OLED version priced at $680 that comes with a special carrying case, a translucent gray body and orange accents.\n\nValve\n\nWrap-up\n\nAccording to the developers I spoke with at Valve, this is the definitive version of the Steam Deck. The HDR OLED model is what they would have released the first time around, if the technology had existed before 2022. The handheld market has evolved quickly \u2014 in just over a year, the Steam Deck proved there\u2019s widespread demand for handheld PCs, and its success helped drive chip makers and display manufacturers to build hardware specifically for high-fidelity mobile play. This is great news for Valve and the Steam Deck, and also the other handhelds coming out of companies like Ayaneo, ASUS, Ayn, Logitech, Retroid and Razer. Hell, maybe even Playdate will get an HDR OLED display one day. (Just kidding; Playdate is literally perfect).\n\nSo, no, the HDR OLED refresh isn't the Steam Deck 2, but it is a welcome improvement on an already good device. The Steam Deck OLED is the facetuned, photoshopped, spit-shined version of Valve\u2019s handheld, and it features tangible, clever improvements. The updated display is the highlight of the device, while things like faster charging, improved antennas and smoother haptics are welcome bonuses. More importantly, this is Valve renewing its commitment to portable PC gaming, and that\u2019s a relief to see. The Steam Deck is the granddaddy of handheld PCs and Valve has the resources to continue innovating in this space. For now, the OLED model is a half-step toward the Steam Deck 2, which may be the final version of the device \u2014 unless Valve finally learns how to count to three."

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nJada Pinkett Smith has revealed why she and her husband Will Smith never signed a prenuptial agreement before getting married.\n\nThe former talk show host, 52, spoke candidly about her husband during a recent interview with Parade. While discussing her new memoir, Worthy, Jada revealed that she and Will didn\u2019t sign a prenup when they were married in 1997 because they knew divorce wasn\u2019t in the cards for them.\n\n\u201cListen, weddings are beautiful, but they can be very romanticised,\u201d Jada said. \u201cI feel that was a very real moment for the two of us to look each other in the eyes, recognise that there would be tough times in this journey and to say to each other: \u2018No matter what, we\u2019re going to figure it out and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t need a prenup, because I\u2019m making a promise that divorce won\u2019t be necessary, that we will figure this out.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Girls Trip star explained how she and Will casually promised not to get a divorce, and how that decision impacted their perspective on on marriage.\n\n\u201cAnd we made that promise to each other without all of the bridal wedding beauty; it was just sitting on a log in his mother\u2019s backyard, and going: \u2018Hey\u2019 - having to really look at the possibility of us not being together,\u201d she said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Jada has opened up about her long-term commitment to her husband. During an interview with Hoda Kotb for Today, which aired on 13 October, the actor confirmed that she and her partner have been living \u201ccompletely separate lives\u201d for the past seven years. However, according to Jada, their choice to live in separate homes doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ll be getting divorced anytime soon.\n\n\u201cI made a promise that there will never be a reason for us to get a divorce,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will work through whatever. And I just haven\u2019t been able to break that promise.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why she and Will didn\u2019t \u201cjust amicably divorce,\u201d Jada simply replied: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\nShe then explained how her family shaped that decision, as she and the King Richard star share two children - Jaden, 25, and Willow, 22. Will also has a 30-year-old son, Trey, who he shares with ex-wife Sheree Zampino. \u201cWe love our family and we love each other. It\u2019s more of a life partnership,\" Jada explained. \"Now, 10 years from now, Hoda, who knows?\u201d\n\nDuring a 2018 episode of her Facebook Watch series, Red Table Talk, Jada doubled down on her stance about divorce, as she recalled the the hard conversation she had with Will about the topic before they got married.\n\n(Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI told Will from the gate, I said let me tell you something: \u2018If you marry me, know this: we\u2019re gonna be together. We\u2019re going to be under the same roof,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cFor me personally, I\u2019m not mature enough to have a divorce, I\u2019m just not. I don\u2019t think I would ever be mature enough, I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star has also shared similar sentiments, as he said during an appearance on the Ellen Degeneres Show that \u201cdivorce just can\u2019t be an option\u201d for him and Jada. \u201cIt\u2019s really that simple. And I think that\u2019s the problem with LA - there are so many options. So a huge part of the success for [Jada] and I is that we just removed the other options.\u201d\n\nLast week, Jada made headlines when she revealed that at the time of the 2022 Academy Awards, when Will slapped Chris Rock, she and her husband had been separated for six years. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing some really heavy-duty work together,\u201d she said during an interview with People. \u201cWe just got deep love for each other and we are going to figure out what that looks like for us.\u201d\n\nJada then praised her children for how they\u2019ve helped her grow, adding: \u201cMy children, they\u2019re little gurus. They\u2019ve taught me a deep sense of self-acceptance.\u201d\n\nOn 16 October, Will broke his silence on his wife\u2019s comments during an interview with the New York Times. The outlet noted that he said his partner\u2019s memoir \u201ckind of woke him up\u201d and that he has now realised she is more \u201cresilient, clever and compassionate than he\u2019d understood\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve been with someone for more than half of your life, a sort of emotional blindness sets in, and you can all too easily lose your sensitivity to their hidden nuances and subtle beauties,\u201d Will added."

Both Jada and Will have previously doubled down on their stance against getting a divorce, but her recent reveal about their lengthy separation poses a new question: When should couples just get a divorce?\n\nIn an interview with People on 10 October, Jada shared that during the 2022 Academy Awards - when Will slapped Chris Rock after he cracked a joke about Jada\u2019s appearance - the pair had actually been separated for six years. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing some really heavy-duty work together,\u201d she explained, while promoting her new memoir, Worthy. \u201cWe just got deep love for each other and we are going to figure out what that looks like for us.\u201d\n\nShe praised her and Will\u2019s two children - Jaden, 25, and Willow, 22 - for being her \u201clittle gurus\u201d throughout this time, noting that they\u2019ve taught her \u201ca deep sense of self-acceptance\u201d. Although the married couple are not living together, she insisted that their marriage has never been an open one, as she and Will have \u201celiminated the chance of betrayal\u201d while going on to live their \u201cseparate lives\u201d.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Jada and Will have taken some time apart from each other. During a 2020 episode of her Facebook Watch series, Red Table Talk, Jada disclosed that while she and Will were separated amicably, she had a relationship with singer August Alsina, describing their involvement as an \u201centanglement\u201d.\n\nThroughout their marriage of 26 years, the A-listers have made it clear that divorce was never in the cards. Jada furthered that belief during a preview for an interview with Today\u2019s Hoda Kotb, which aired on 13 October. \u201cI made a promise that there will never be a reason for us to get a divorce,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will work through, whatever. I just haven\u2019t been able to break that promise.\u201d\n\nOf course, outsiders aren\u2019t fully aware of the \u201cheavy-duty work\u201d that Jada and Will have done throughout their marriage. But the amount of time they\u2019ve spent separated begs questions about all long-term relationships in general. When is it the time for couples to throw the towel in? And when should separations ultimately become the end result that couples have tried to avoid: divorce.\n\nWhile there\u2019s never a simple answer to the question, relationship experts have discovered the signs that it\u2019s time to keep fighting for the one you love, or time to let them go.\n\nSpeaking to The Independent, New York City-based relationship expert Susan Winter highlighted the jarring differences between a separation and divorce. When it comes to divorce, Hollywood couples can notably get involved in lengthy legal processes, from dividing financial assets to creating child custody agreements. Although we don\u2019t know the terms of Jada and Will\u2019s separation, Winter believes that they\u2019re showcasing a non-conventional relationship that\u2019s not familiar to the public. Will and Jada\u2019s dynamic includes living in separate homes, but it could be a choice that\u2019s for the better.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an LAT partnership, meaning \u2018living apart together,\u2019\u201d Winter said. \u201cWhile everybody is at a different point as to why they are doing this, the centre point is the same: the preservation of the partnership is paramount. Separations can also be beneficial if both individuals are working on themselves and have the mutual goal of reuniting, or making their relationship better. However, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that their improved relationship will result in them living together again.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, dating coach Jacob Lucas - who\u2019s based in the UK - acknowledged that not all separations end in resolutions. When couples opt not to live together anymore, it could create an emotional disconnect between them. If a lack of connection occurred before couples separated, that separation doesn\u2019t necessarily make the issues go away. In fact, Lucas believes that in these situations, couples could also be avoiding the inevitable breakup for the sake of comfortability.\n\n(AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not resolving their problems, they\u2019re rescheduling them. So, if you separate from someone, but you live in a separate house and you\u2019re still together, it seems to me you\u2019re just not letting go of the past because you want to stick to what\u2019s familiar,\u201d he claimed. \u201cPeople stick to what they know, and it\u2019s like you have a tether to that person. Your brain\u2019s like: \u2018I cannot let go of them because I am scared of the unknown.\u2019 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a couple separate and come back again.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Jada and Will plan on ending their separation and living in the same home again. However, the couple have been candid about their plans to not get a divorce. Jada previously recalled that when she first decided to get married to Will in 1997, it would be for the long haul. \u201cI told Will from the gate, I said let me tell you something: \u2018If you marry me, know this: we\u2019re gonna be together. We\u2019re going to be under the same roof,\u2019\u201d she said during a 2018 episode of Red Table Talk. \u201cFor me personally, I\u2019m not mature enough to have a divorce, I\u2019m just not. I don\u2019t think I would ever be mature enough, I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWill - who divorced his first wife, Sheree Zampino, in 1994 - has also shared similar sentiments about making his marriage with Jada work. Back in 2006, the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star first explained to MTV News that divorce wasn\u2019t an option for him and his second wife. \u201cWith Jada, I stood up in front of God and said: \u2018Til death do us part,\u2019\u201d he said at the time. \u201cSo there are two possible outcomes. One, we are going to be together \u2018til death, or two, I am dead.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to The Independent, Lucas noted that while it\u2019s important for both parties to be invested in their relationships, promising not to get a divorce could spark feelings of resentment down the line. Fans aren\u2019t fully aware of why Will and Jada made that promise to each other, but the dating coach believes that an agreement like theirs could create a false narrative about a divorce.\n\nJada Pinkett Smith y Will Smith (Getty Images)\n\n\u201cGetting divorced shouldn\u2019t feel like a taboo because people grow apart and that\u2019s fine,\u201d he explained. \u201cPeople get stuck in relationships because of their friends and family or societal pressure, and they worry about getting divorced. They think a divorce has a stigma to its name, which it doesn\u2019t, and they push aside the fact that they still essentially feel trapped with someone they don\u2019t want to be with.\u201d\n\nPerhaps one of the reasons why Jada and Will have promised not to get a divorce is because they also agreed not to sign a prenuptial agreement. In an interview with Parade published on 13 October, Jada explained it was her special connection with Will that encouraged them not to sign a prenup before getting married.\n\n\u201cI feel that was a very real moment for the two of us to look each other in the eyes, recognise that there would be tough times in this journey and to say to each other: \u2018No matter what, we\u2019re going to figure it out and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t need a prenup, because I\u2019m making a promise that divorce won\u2019t be necessary, that we will figure this out,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd we made that promise to each other without all of the bridal wedding beauty; it was just sitting on a log in his mother\u2019s backyard, and going: \u2018Hey\u2019 - having to really look at the possibility of us not being together.\u201d\n\nAlthough they\u2019ve made their dedication to each other quite clear, there have been some grey areas over the last seven years about the terms of Will and Jada\u2019s separation. In 2020, Jada made headlines when she revealed in a Red Table Talk episode with her husband that she had a relationship with Alsina. She explained that she and her husband were \u201cseparated amicably\u201d when the romance occurred, which had not been disclosed to the press at the time. \u201cWe decided that we were going to separate for a period of time and you go figure out how to make yourself happy and I\u2019ll figure out how to make myself happy,\u201d Jada said. As the Girls Trip star recalled that she \u201cgot into a different kind of entanglement with August,\u201d she was prompted by Will to confirm it \u201cwas a relationship, absolutely.\u201d\n\nOutsiders are now aware that Jada and Will have been separated since 2016, but the timeline of her relationship with Alsina is still fuzzy. Indeed, the terms of Will and Jada\u2019s separation are still unknown to the public and in some cases, having separate relationships can give couples the clarity they need about their marriage.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s pivotal here is, what was the agreement? Did we agree to separate to work on ourselves for the purpose of coming back together again?\u201d Winter said. \u201cDid we agree to separate and just be alone for a while and not have that discussion? And in the second case, if you have an affair, sometimes it can bring you back to the original person. You can get whatever you need to achieve or gain a different perspective, allowing you to decide if you want to come back or leave for good.\u201d\n\nWill Smith y Jada Pinkett Smith (Getty Images)\n\nAccording to Lucas, some of the controversy surrounding Will and Jada\u2019s relationship ties back to the 2022 Academy Awards - when the King Richard star jumped onto the stage and struck Rock across the face after the comedian made a joke about Jada\u2019s shaved head, which is a result of her alopecia. \u201cKeep my wife\u2019s name out of your f***ing mouth,\u201d Will yelled. Now that it\u2019s been revealed the couple was separated at the time, Lucas questioned Will\u2019s behaviour and word choice during the awards ceremony.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a weird reaction to have somebody who you\u2019ve been broken up with for six years, you know? So, were they really broken up or is Jada saying that as an attention-seeking thing?\u201d he asked.\n\nHowever, Winter still believes the controversial incident speaks different volumes about the work Will has put into his relationship. \u201cI feel as though Will has a tremendous love and commitment to Jada, as well as to the marriage and the family unit,\u201d she said. \u201cThe pride that he takes in defending his wife is extraordinary, almost to the detriment of his image, at times.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the public will never fully know what \u201cheavy-duty work\u201d Will and Jada are doing in their relationship, and according to Winter, it\u2019s not necessarily any of our business. Still, she believes that their choice to separate is something fluid and outside of the traditional marriage design - an evolving model that could also come to serve other couples. If Will and Jada have been spending seven years apart as a married couple, why would they decide to go back to living in the same household?\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in the rough with a machete, carving a new path for themselves,\u201d Winter said. \u201cWhy would they say: \u2018Hey, let\u2019s go back to the house and just relax?\u2019 They\u2019re really exploring something vastly different. It doesn\u2019t end up that you go back into that little box of \u2018this is a marriage, we\u2019re living together\u2019. It just doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nEvery relationship is different, living in the public eye or not. Although living separately may not be an issue for some couples, there can still be some major signs that it\u2019s time to leave a relationship behind. \u201cWhen there is no stone left unturned, or when they have tried every single combination possible to make the relationship function and yet it doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s the time to pull the plug,\u201d Winter added. \u201cThey\u2019ve done their individual work and they have done the work together and ended up in the same place.\u201d\n\nWill and Jada\u2019s relationship could end in a variety of ways. The celebrity couple could stay separated, move back in together as a married pair, or they can get a divorce. However, there are still certain behaviours in a marriage that could signal it\u2019s time to get a divorce.\n\n\u201cIf you feel disrespected by your partner, feel humiliated, or were cheated on, you probably feel ready to split,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cI also think a real big one is, if you lose sexual attraction for your partner and you\u2019ve actively tried to get it back and can\u2019t, it\u2019s time to go.\u201d"
