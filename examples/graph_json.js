The company has faced legal disputes with Epic over app store fees, anticompetitive behavior, and potential antitrust violations, specifically regarding payment systems and settlements. Despite its significant influence and control over user experience, Google has been slow to communicate with individuals, possibly due to negative public perception. Additionally, Google has been highlighted for its annual hardware events, showcasing new products and updates. It is also the defendant in a lawsuit for causing harm to competition and consumers in the digital news publishing industry. Google\'s guidelines are sometimes violated by SEO professionals, affecting search engine results. Moreover, Google has been mentioned as the provider of Google Pixel 7A, with features such as smooth performance, bright screen, excellent cameras, and wireless charging. The company also pays Apple for placement on its platforms and has ceased live traffic updates in conflict areas for safety reasons during military movements.
